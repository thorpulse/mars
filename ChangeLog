IMPORTANT: the historic distinction between MARS Light and the future
MARS Full has been dropped. Now all versions are simply called "mars".

Old tagnames light* will remain valid, but newer names will follow the
convention s/light/mars/g (this means that the old version number counting
will be continued, only the "light" is substituted).


Meaning of stable tagnames
--------------------------

Example: mars0.1stable01:
             0             = version of on-disk data structures
                            (only incremented when downgrades are impossible)
                            (not incremented on backwards-compatible upgrades)
               1           = version of feature set
                stable     = feature set is frozen during this series
                      01   = bugfix revision

Example: mars0.2beta2.3:
			   The general idea is as before.
			   "beta" means that new features are roughly tested
			   in the lab, but not in production, so there may be
	                   some bugs. New features may be added during
			   the beta phase.

Example: mars0.3alpha*:
			  Never use this for production. Only for historic
			  code inspection.

Release Conventions / Branches / Tagnames
-----------------------------------------
	FLOW OF BUGFIXES: 0.1 -> 0.1b -> 0.2 -> ...

	mars0.1 series (stable):
		 - Asynchronous replication.
		   Currently operational at more than 3000 servers at
		   1&1, more than 25,000,000 operating hours (Feb 2017)
		 - Unstable tagnames: light0.1beta%d.%d (obsolete)
		 - Stable branch: mars0.1.y
		 - Stable tagnames: mars0.1stable%02d

	mars0.1b series (currently alpha):
		 This is an _imtermediate_ series between 0.1 and 0.2.
		 The goal is to improve _scalability_ to thousands of
		 hosts in one cluster, as well as thousands of resources.
		 Likely, this intermdiate branch will be merged into 0.2
		 and then continue development there. When this point
		 will arrive is uncertain at the moment.
		 Likely, the stabilization of the new scalability features
		 will occur together with the 0.2 series.
		 Reason for this: the rollout strategy at 1&1 to
		 thousands of machines wants to do small incremental
		 steps. The risk of directly going to 0.2 in _masses_
		 is minimized by first rolling out the really necessary
		 changes, and to postpone those developments which are
		 currently not yet really needed in mass deployment.

	mars0.2 series (currently in beta stage):
		   Mostly for internal needs of 1&1 (but not limited to that).
		 - Getting rid of the kernel prepatch! MARS may be built
		   as an external kernel module for any supported
		   kernel version. First prototype is only tested for
		   unaltered 3.2.x vanilla kernel, but compatibility to
		   further vanilla kernel versions (maybe even
		   Redhat-specific ones) will follow during the course of
		   the MARS mars0.2 stable series. The problem is not
		   compatibility as such, but _testing_ that it really
		   works. These tests need a lot of time.
		   => further arguments for getting to kernel upstream ASAP.
		 - Improved network throughput by parallel TCP connections
		   (in particular under packet loss).
		   Also called "socket bundling".
		   First benchmarks show an impressive speedup over
		   highly congested long-distance lines.
		 - Future-proof updates in the network protocol:
		   Mixed operation of 32/64bit and/or {big,low}endian
		 - Support for multi-homed network interfaces.
		 - Transparent data compression over low bandwidth lines.
		   Consumes a lot of CPU, therefore only recommended for
		   low write loads or for desperate network situations.
		 - Remote device: bypassing iSCSI. In essence,
		   /dev/mars/mydata can appear at any other cluster member
		   which doesn't necessarily need any local disks.
		 - Various smaller features and improvements.
		 - Unstable tagnames: mars0.2beta%d.%d (current)
		 - Stable branch: mars0.2.y (already in use for beta)
		 - Stable tagnames: mars0.2stable%02d (planned)

	mars0.3 series (planned):
		   (some might possibly go to 1.0 series instead)
		 - Improve replication latency.
		 - New pseudo-synchronous replication modes.
		   For the internal needs of database folks at 1&1.
		 - (Maybe) old test suite could be retired, a new
		   one is at github.com/schoebel/test-suite
		 - Unstable tagnames: mars0.3beta%d.%d (planned)
		 - Stable branch: mars0.3.y (planned)
		 - Stable tagnames: mars0.3stable%02d (planned)

	mars1.0 series (planned):
		 - Replace symlink tree by transactional status files
		   (future-proof)
		   This is required for upstream merging to the kernel.
		   It has further advantages, such as better scalability.
		 - Trying to additionally address public needs.
		 - Potentially for Linux kernel upstream,
		 - Unstable tagnames: mars1.0beta%d.%d (planned)
		 - Stable branch: mars1.0.y (planned)
		 - Stable tagnames: mars1.0stable%02d (planned)

	WIP-* branches are for development and may be rebased onto anything
	at any time without notice. They will disappear eventually.

	*stable* branches mean that only bug fixes and documentation
	updates / clarifications will be applied. Updates to the test suite /
	new test cases potentially disguising bugs, and other minor additions
	of debugging code / paranoia code which may lead to discovery
	of bugs are also possible. Error messages / warnings and their
	error class may	also be changed.
	NO NEW FEATURES, not even minor ones, except when absolutely
	necessary for a bugfix, or for an important usability improvement
	(such as clearer display of errors, hints for resolving them, etc).

-----------------------------------
Changelog for series 0.2:

(you need to checkout branch mars0.2.y to see any details)

-----------------------------------
Changelog for series 0.1b:

mars0.1balpha3.5
--------
	* Merge	fixes from mars0.1stable41 (see there)
	* Doc update on socket bundling.

mars0.1balpha3.4
--------
	* Merge	fix from mars0.1stable40 (see there)

mars0.1balpha3.3
--------
	* Merge	fixes from mars0.1stable39
	* Major fix: copy was sometimes hanging.
	* Minor fix: unnecessary delay of metadata propagation.
	* Performance improvements / bottleneck enhancenemts:
	  - Lamport clock
	  - Network
	  - md5 checksumming
	* Userspace: faster logfile deletion via cron job.

mars0.1balpha3.2
--------
	* Merge	mars0.1stable38: now compiles without pre-patch
	  on certain kernel versions. Please read ChangeLog there.

mars0.1balpha3.1
--------
	* Minor fix: deadlock on termination of copy thread.

mars0.1balpha3
--------
	* Some tuning (more to come later):
	  * Speedup network by better corking.
	  * New scalable Lamport clock implementation.

mars0.1balpha2
--------
	* Socket bundling (cherry-picked from mars0.2.y).
	* Speedup copy processes (sync, logfile transfer).
	* Speedup bio and md5 checksumming.

mars0.1balpha1
--------
	* First improvements for scalability to more than 10 resources
	  per node. Already tested with 128 resources on a pair of nodes.
	  More improvements to come later.
	  No functional changes otherwise (from a sysadmin perspective).
	  Rollback to stable series 0.1 should be possible at
	  any time.
	* Include fix from 0.1stable37.

mars0.1balpha0
--------
	* Minor fix: the 1&1 specific feature set-sync-pref-list was
	  not used at all. Without it, the limitation feature for the sync
	  parallelism degree did not work correctly (without leading to harm,
	  other than optimum sync throughput / performance).
	  Removed the old _obsolete_ feature (for formal reasons,
	  this cannot be done in the 0.1stable branch).
	  Re-implemnented the feature in a very simple form,
	  which is hopefully "obviously correct" now.
	* Minor feature: please use "marsadm cron" as a fool-proof short form,
	  in particular at cron jobs.

-----------------------------------
Changelog for series 0.1:

mars0.1stable41
--------
	* Minor fix: a scarce race could lead to an unnecessary split brain
	  when umounting _after_ role transition from primary to secondary.

mars0.1stable40
--------
	* Potentially critical fix: on very fast machines, and with
	  extremely low probability, a race in AIO could lead to a kernel
	  page fault.
	  For maximum safety, update to this version is recommended.

mars0.1stable39
--------
	* Minor fix: hangs of logfile updates. Found by stress-testing
	  on fast hardware over 10GBit network links. Might explain
	  some extremely rare (1 per several millions of operations hours)
	  production hangs on secondaries. Workaround possible by
	  "pause-fetch; resume-fetch".
	* Minor fixes of rare kthread retarding under very high load.
	* Minor improvement: add version number to "marsadm version" which
	  can be used for future compatibilty checking with respect to
	  new features.

mars0.1stable38
--------
	* Compile without pre-patch on some kernel versions!
	  Whether the pre-patch is applied will be detected automatically.
	  However, there is some (hopefully minor) performance penalty when
	  the pre-patch is missing.
	  This will be addressed in a future release (but might go
	  to branch 0.1b instead, not yet decided).
	  Tested with vanilla kernels 3.10.105, 3.14.79, 3.16.43,
	  4.1.39, 4.4.67.
	  Vanilla kernels 4.8.x and later are _not_ yet working
	  (independently from pre-patches). This will be addressed
	  in a future release.
	* No functional changes otherwise. Rollback to prior versions
	  should be easy. Please report any issues.
	* Updated docs describing build methods.

mars0.1stable37
--------
	* Minor fix: secondary logfile replication could hang in the
	  extremely unusual case that the expected primary logfile size
	  gets shortened after a crash followed by reboot.
	  Workaround was possible via "pause-fetch; resume-fetch".

mars0.1stable36
--------
	* Doc: new slides from GUUG2017, both in English and in German.
	  Some very important hints for cost savings. May easily save
	  you a few millions when operating some petabytes of data.
	* Doc: new chapter on cost savings in mars-manual.pdf.
	  Some parts of German oral explanations from the GUUG conference
	  translated to English for my English-speaking audience.
	  More to come later (hopefully; I need to get the time).

mars0.1stable35
--------
	* Minor fix: when syncing a big resource (e.g. 40TiB) over an 1GBit
	  uplink, the sync may take longer than 1 day. This increases the
	  probability for triggering an unintended restart of that sync
	  from scratch.
	  Among further obscure preconditions, more than 5 logfiles must
	  exist such that the wrong assumption of an emergency mode can
	  happen at the secondary. In order to trigger the bug more likely,
	  it is therefore helpful to misconfigure /etc/cron.d/mars by
	  log-rotate'ing every 10 minutes, but doing log-delete-all only
	  once an hour (which contradicts my upstream documentation and
	  unnecessarily wastes valuable storage space in /mars).
	  Fixed by correction of a typo-like error.

mars0.1stable34
--------
	* Minor fix: in some rare cases, when lots of gigabytes had to be
	  replayed in one big slurp, the replay position wasn't updated
	  during a longer time. Some admins were complaining that it
	  appeared "stuck" although it worked in reality.
	  Improved by increasing the update frequency of the replay link.
	* Minor fix: after network errors, sometimes the sync restarted
	  from scratch, unnecessarily.
	* Minor fix: under rare conditions, rmmod could hang forever.
	  A known reason has been fixed. Other theoretical reasons
	  hopefully improved by some further safeguards.

mars0.1stable33
--------
	* Minor regression from stable29:
	  After a primary crash, without switchover, and when the primary
	  recovery phase involves a logrotate to an empty new logfile
	  which had been in the meantime shortly before the crash but
	  has not yet been used before the crash (race condition),
	  a kernel NULL pointer deref may stop the main thread.
	  Workaround: either remove the empty logfile by hand,
	  or just do a failover to the other side.

mars0.1stable32
--------
	* Critical regression between stable30 and stable31 (can be avoided
	  by simply using stable30 for affected kernels): on _old_ kernels
	  (before 4.3.x) the removal of merge_bvec_fn() (see upstream commit
	  8ae126660fddbeebb9251a174e6fa45b6ad8f932) can lead to fatal
	  crashes at the primary side.
	  Fixed by using (hopefully) proper #ifdef's according to the
	  kernel version.
	  Notice: between stable30 and stable31 no true MARS fixes were
	  made (since no bugs were found). This strategy is likely to
	  continue for a while, for newer adaptations to even newer kernels.
	  In case of problems, go back. And, please, report it to me :)

mars0.1stable31
--------
	* New _minimum_ pre-patches for vanilla LTS kernels 3.2.x to 4.7.x.
	  For security reasons, please prefer them over the old _generic_
	  pre-patch versions which expose many unnecessary EXPORT_SYMBOL
	  to potential attackers.
	* Adaptions to vanilla kernels up to 4.7.x.
	  Note: 4.8rc-* does not yet work.
	* Regression testing with many kernel versions: looks fine.

mars0.1stable30
--------
	* Minor fix: in very rare cases of a primary crash, a missing
	  versionlink could lead to a hang.
	* Minor fix: improved error reporting of replay code.
	* Minor fix: improved switchback to former primary side.
	* Minor fix: systematically add some missing macros.
	* Minor improvements: add some example systemd unit and other
	  contrib stuff like a cronjob example.
	* Doc: minor additions and improvements.

mars0.1stable29
--------
	* Minor fix: on very fast hardware and networks, sync could take
	  a while for terminating.
	* Minor fix: external module build.
	* Major usability improvement: new expert commands marsadm
	  lowlevel-ls-host-ips, lowlevel-set-host-ip, lowlevel-delete-host.
	  Necessary for moves between networks, dedicated replication IPs,
	  etc.
	* Minor doc update.

mars0.1stable28
--------
	* Doc: describe new naming conventions.
	  MARS Light is now simply called MARS.
	  No distinction between "Light" and the future "Full" anymore.
	  Please note that the git branches light0.1.y and light0.2.y have
	  been renamed to mars0.1.y and mars0.2.y respectively.
	* Minor sourcecode cleanup: s/light//g or s/light/main/g
	  where appropriate.
	  No other changes in the sourcecode, deliberately.
	  In case anyone encounters any build problems compiling MARS,
	  this release is separated just for the sake of build testing,
	  or Debian packaging testing, etc.
	* Doc: minor clarifications.

mars0.1stable27
light0.1stable27
--------
	* Critical fix: typo in sync progress comparison code could lead
	  to data version mismatches during sync when alternating with
	  replay. Only observed at a certain new hardware class, and only
	  while testing with an extremely high load (9 loaded resources
	  in parallel to 9 concurrent syncs). As a workaround,
	  echo 0 > /proc/sys/mars/sync_flip_interval_sec can be used.
	  Nevertheless, update is highly recommended!
	* Major fix: slow memory leak (regression from light0.1stable26).
	  Only when starting the transaction logger (i.e. primary is typically
	  not affected). But don't let run it for a longer time.
	  Monitoring is possible via /proc/slabinfo (size-64 or siblings).
	* Minor fix: join-cluster did not check for duplicate IP addresses.
	* Minor fixes: some unnecessary annoying error messages.
	* Docu: new slides from GUUG 2016 in Köln.

light0.1stable26
--------
	* Minor fixes: some primitive macros were reporting misleading or
	  even wrong values at split brain, or during/after emergency mode.
	  Some high-level macros as well as try_to_avoid_split_brain
	  should work better / more reliable now.
	* Minor fix: potential deadlock after crash reboot, or after
	  defective /mars filesystem. Never observed in practice.
	* Minor safeguard: unnecessary split brain could emerge at
	  secondaries under extremely rare and strange conditions.
	  Unsure whether it ever occurred in practice.
	* Minor usability improvement: show incorrect permissions on /mars.
	  Some other sysadmin tools like Puppet seem to have their own
	  default notion of "secure permissions" ;)
	* Minor doc reorg, better chapter structure.

light0.1stable25
--------
	* Major fix: in rare cases "marsadm primary" (without --force)
	  could go into an endless loop, even if --timeout= was specified.
	* Minor fix: in rare cases of hanging or defective IO, crashes
	  of the primary could replicate versionlinks to the secondary,
	  but after reboot they were missing at the primary because of
	  of hanging IO or other IO / RAID controller problems.
	  Now using sync_filesystem() for either ensuring actuality,
	  or for letting the mars_light main control thread hang
	  (which will hopefully be noticed soon by monitoring).
	* Minor fix: join-cluster uses rsync, which could abort due to
	  vanished filesystem objects while the primary is actively running.
	  Now it should tolerate such "errors".
	* Minor fixes / additions at primitive macros.
	* Tiny doc update.

light0.1stable24
--------
	* Skip this release due to a regression.

light0.1stable23
--------
	* Minor fix: the new replay-code error message was forgotten
	  to reset at secondaries. Now the annoying old error message
	  disappears after the next successful logrotate.
	* Minor fixes of internal marsadm code (not in use until now).
	* Minor doc update.

light0.1stable22
--------
	* Critical fix for non-storage servers: the /mars directory
	  was readable by ordinary non-root users, opening a potential
	  security hole. Originally MARS was designed for standalone
	  storage servers solely, but now it is increasingly deployed to
	  machines where ordinary users can log in.
	  Update recommended, but only urgent for potentially affected
	  installations.
	* Minor fix: when a logfile was damaged (observed at defective
	  hardware), this was often (but not always) detected by the
	  md5 data checksums in the transaction logfiles. So far so good.
	  The replay / recovery process stopped for a very good reason.
	  But it was not easily possible to _force_ any of the resource
	  members into primary role when the defect was already present at
	  the _primary_ (which happend once during 7 millions of operating
	  hours, and at a primary site which proved defective afterwards),
	  and the defect had been replicated to all secondaries.
	  As a workaround, the resource could be destroyed via leave-resource
	  everywhere, and re-surrected from scratch. Clumsy.
	  Now an md5 checksum error in the middle of a logfile is
	  treated similarly to an EOF. "primary --force" will succeed now,
	  without applying the defective data (as before).
	  Split brain will result for sure in such a case.
	* Minor improvement: md5 logfile checksum errors are now displayed
	  directly in the diskstate macro (and therefore also at plain
	  "view").
	* Minor improvement: when "marsadm view all" told you "InConsistent"
	  as the disk state, this was _formally correct_ because it related
	  to the state of the _disk_, not to the state of the replication.
	  The former message could appear regularly during ordinary
	  out-of-order writeback at the primary side, without violating
	  the consistency of /dev/mars/mydata.
	  However, many people were confused and alarmed by the irritating
	  message.
	  Now a better wording is used: "WriteBack" and "Recovery" describes
	  more intuitively what is really happening :)
	* Minor doc improvements.

light0.1stable21
--------
	* Hint: now MARS has been rolled out to more than 1600 servers,
	  including some MySQL database servers, and has collected more
	  than 6 millions of operation hours.
	* Minor fixes, none of them observed in practice, only found
	  by testing while working on new features:
	  - potential read page fault
	  - potential deadlock
	  - incorrect remote symlink update under untypical circumstances

light0.1stable20
--------
	* Hint: MARS is now running on more than 850 storage servers,
	  and has collected more than 4.5 millions of operation hours.
	  There were no new incidents with customer impact since the last
	  major bugfix (more than 3 millions of operation hours since then).
	  It is difficult to deduce a reliability from that, but it appears
	  that at least 99.999%, if not 99.9999% are now real for the
	  MARS component as a standalone component (not to be confused with
	  overall system reliability). Our storage hardware is clearly much
	  less reliable. MARS does compensate these defects all the time.

	* Minor fix: memory leak in networking code, does not occur
	  at light0.1 operations (but maybe future versions of MARS).
	* Doc: add presentation slides from Froscon2015.

light0.1stable19
--------
	* Minor safeguard: warn when somebody tries leave-resource --host=
	  for a damaged host, and later the dead host resurrects in an
	  unreasonable way.
	* Doc update: describe use cases for DRBD vs MARS more clearly.
	* Minor spelling fixes.

light0.1stable18
--------
	* Minor safeguard: prevent join-resource when previous log-purge-all
	  has been forgotten. Prevent create-resource also when previous
	  delete-resource has been forgotten. Anyway, this happens only in
	  very exotic repair scenarios after very heavy failures.
	* Doc updates: simplify descriptions of split-brain resolution and
	  emergency mode resolution. Nowadays 'invalidate' will do everything
	  in all tested cases; the more complex alternative methods have
	  been moved to the appendix.

light0.1stable17
--------
	* Minor fix: stacktrace / oops in aio callback path due to a
	  subtle race, observed once during 2.5 millions of operation hours.
	  In the observed case, the secondary was hanging, without
	  customer impact. However, the error class could potentially
	  occur also at the primary side. Probably the bug was triggered
	  by a hardware problem from the RAID controller.

light0.1stable16
--------
	* Minor fix: sync could take a long time to complete under high
	  application load, similarly to a live-lock.
	* Some smaller minor fixes for annoying messages.
	* Contrib: added configurable Nagios check.
	* Contrib: added some example scripts which could be used by
	  clustermanagers etc.
	* Doc: important new section on pitfalls when using existing
	  clustermanagers UNMODIFIED for long distance replication.
	  PLEASE READ!

light0.1stable15
--------
	* NOTICE: MARS succeeded baptism on fire at 04/22/2015 when a whole
	  co-location had a partial power blackout, followed by breakdown
	  of air conditioning, followed by mass hardware defects due to
	  overheating. MARS showed exactly 0 errors when (emergency)
	  switching to another datacenter was started in masses.
	* Major fix of race in transaction logger: the primary could hang
	  when using very fast hardware, typically after ~24000 operation
	  hours. The problem was noticed 6 times during a grand total of
	  more than 1,000,000 operation hours on a mixed hardware park,
	  showing up only on specific hardware classes. Together with 3
	  other incidents during early beta phase which also had customer
	  impact, this means that we have reached a reliability of about
				  ===> 99.999%
	  After this fix, the reliability should grow even higher.
	  A workaround for this bug exists:
	  # echo 2 > /proc/sys/mars/logger_completion_semantics
	  Update is only mandatory when you cannot use the workaround.
	* Minor improvement in marsadm: re-allow --force combined with "all".
	  This is highly appreciated for speeding up operations / handling
	  during emergency datacenter switchover.
	* Various smaller improvements.
	* Contrib (unsupported): example rollout script for mass rollout.

light0.1stable14
--------
	* Minor safeguard: modprobe mars will refuse to start when the
	  cluster UUID is missing.
	* Minor fix: external race in marsadm resize, only relevant
	  for scripting.
	* Minor fix: potential race on plugged IO requests.
	* Clarify output of marsadm view. Many systematical improvements
	  and hints.
	* Add some unevitable macros for scripting / automation.
	* Various tiny improvements.

light0.1stable13
--------
	* Critical safeguard for accidental join-cluster with wrong argument:
	  make UUID mandatory, disallow completely unrelated hosts to
	  communicate symlink tree updates when their UUIDs mismatch.
	* Minor fix: leave-resource --host=other did not work when disks
	  were named differently throughout the cluster.
	* Minor fix: detach --host=other --force (which is needed as a
	  precondition) did not work.
	* Various minor fixes and clarifications. "marsadm view all"
	  now reports the communication status in the cluster.

light0.1stable12
--------
	* Critical (but usually not extremely relevant) fix:
	  When emergency mode occurs just during a sync, the target could
	  remain inconsistent without notice. Now noticed.
	  You always could/should manually invalidate whenever an
	  emergency mode appeared.
	  Now this is automatically fixed by restarting any sync from
	  scratch (if one was actually running before; otherwise consistency
	  was never violated).
	* Major documentation update / corrections.
	* Major (but less relevant) fix: leave-cluster did not really work.
	* Minor fix (regression): rmmod could hang when sync was running.
	* Various minor fixes and clarifications.

light0.1stable11
--------
	* Major documentation update. mars-manual.pdf increased from
	  66 to 80 pages. Please read! You probably should know this.
	* Minor fixes: better cleanup on invalidate / leave-resource.
	* Minor clarifications: more precise EIO error codes, more verbose
	  error reporting via "marsadm cat".

light0.1stable10
--------
	* Major fixes of internal network protocol errors, leading to
	  internal shutdown of sockets, which were transparently re-opened.
	  It could affect network performance. Not sure whether
	  stability was also affected (probably under extremely high load);
	  for better safety you should upgrade.
	* Major fix from Manuel Lausch: regex parsing sometimes went
	  completely wrong when hostnames followed a similar name scheme
	  than internal symlinks.
	* Major, only relevant for k>2 replicas: fix wrong internal sharing
	  of data structures resulting from parallel data connections.
	* Minor fix: race in fake-sync.
	* Minor fix: race in invalidate.
	* Minor, only for k>2 replicas: fix direct primary handover when
	  some non-involved hosts are currently unreachable.
	* Minor: improve becoming primary during split brain.
	* Minor: improve becoming primary when emergency mode starts.
	* Minor: silence some annoying stderr messages.
	* Several internal minor fixes and clarifications.

light0.1stable09
--------
	* Major fix of scarce race (potentially critical): the bio response
	  thread could terminate too early, leading to a premature dealloc
	  of kernel memory. This has only been observed on slow virtual
	  machines with slow virtual devices, and very high load on k=4
	  replicas. This could potentially affect the stability of the system.
	  Although not observed at production machines at 1&1, I recommend
	  updating production machines to this release ASAP.
	* Major usability fix: incorrect commandline options of marsadm
	  were just ignored if they appeared after the resource argument.
	  Misspellings could cause undesired effects. For instance,
	  "marsadm delete-resource vital --force --MISSPELLhost=banana"
	  was accidentally destroying the primary during operation (which
	  is _possible_ when using --force, and this was even a _required_
	  sort of "STONITH"-like feature -- however from a human point
	  of view it was intended to destroy _another_ host, so this was
	  an unexpected behaviour from a sysadmin point of view).
	* Major workaround: the concept "actual primary" is wrong, because
	  during split brain there may exist several primaries. Do not
	  use the macro view-actual-primary any longer. It is deprecated now.
	  Use view-is-primary instead, on each host you are interested in.
	* Minor fix: "marsadm invalidate" did not work in some weired
	  split brain situations / was not equivalent to
	  "marsadm leave-resource $res; marsadm join-resource $res".
	  The latter was the old workaround to fix the situation.
	  Now it shouldn't be necessary anymore.
	* Minor fix: pause-fetch could take very long to terminate.
	* Minor fix: marsadm wait-cluster did not wait for all hosts
	  particiapting in the resource, but only for one of them.
	  This is only relevant for k>2 replicas.
	* Minor fix: the rates displayed by "marsadm view" did not drop down
	  to 0 when no progress was made.
	* Minor fix: logging to syslog was incomplete.
	* Minor usability fix: decrease boring speakyness of "log-rotate"
	  and "log-delete" for cron jobs.
	* Minor fixes: several internal awkwardnesses, potentially affecting
	  performance and/or stability in weired situations.

light0.1stable08
--------
	 * Minor fix: after emergency mode, a versionlink was forgotten
	   to create. This could lead to unnecessary reports of split
	   brain and/or need for additional re-invalidate.
	 * Minor fix: the predicate 'view-is-consistent' reported 'false'
	   in some situations on secondaries when all was ok.
	 * Minor fix: it was impossible to determine the 'is-consistent'
	   from 'marsadm view' (without -1and1 suffix). Added a new [Cc-]
	   flag. This is absolutely needed to determine whether the
	   underlying disks must have the same checksum (provided that
	   both disks are detached and the network works and fetch+replay
	   had completed before the detach).
	 * Updated docs to reflect this.
	 * Minor fix: 'invalidate' did not work when the resource was not
	   completely detached. Now it implicitly does a detach before
	   starting invalidation.
	 * Minor fix: wait-umount was waiting for umount of _all_ primaries
	   during split brain. Now it waits only for umount of the local node.
	   Notice that having multiple primaries in parallel is an
	   erroneous state anyway.
	 * Minor fix: leave-cluster did not work without --force.

light0.1stable07
--------
	 * Minor fix: re-creation of a completely destroyed resource
	   did not always work correctly

light0.1stable06
--------
	 * Major fix: becoming primary was hanging in scarce situations.
	 * Minor fix: some split brains were not always detected correctly.
	 * Minor fix for Redhat openvz kernel builds.
	 * Several fixes for 1&1 internal Debian builds.

light0.1stable05
--------
	 * Major fix: incomplete calls to vfs_readdir()
	   which could lead to incomplete symlink updates /
	   replication hangs.
	 * Minor fix: scarce race on replay EOF.
	 * Separated kernel from userspace build environment.
	 * Removed some potentially dangerous Kconfig options
	   if they would be set to wrong values (robustness against
	   accidentally producing bad kernel modules).
	 * Dito: some additional checks against bad main Kconfig options
	   (mainly for out-of-tree builds).
	 * Separated contrib code from maintained code.
	 * Added some pre-patches for newer kernels
	   (WIP - not yet fully tested at all combinations)
	 * Minor doc addition: LinuxTag 2014 presentation.

light0.1stable04
--------
	 * Quiet annoying error message.
	 * Minor readability improvements.
	 * Minor doc updates.

light0.1stable03
--------
	 * Major: fix internal aio race (could lead to memory corruption).
	 * Fix refcounting in trans_logger.
	 * Some minor fixes in module code.
	 * Fix 1&1-internal out-of-tree builds.
	 * Various minor fixes.
	 * Update monitoring tools / docs (German, contributed by Jörg Mann).

light0.1stable02
--------
	 * Fix sorting of internal data structure.
	 * Fix IO error propagation at replay.

light0.1stable01
--------
	 * Fix parallelism of logfile propagation: sometimes a secondary
	   could get a more recent version than the primary had on stable
	   storage after its crash, eventually leading to an (annoying)
	   split brain. Some people might take this as a feature instead
	   of a bug, but now the logfile transfer starts only after the
	   primary _knows_ that the data is successfully committed to
	   stable storage.
	 * Fix memory leaks in error path.
	 * Fix error propagation between client and server.
	 * Make string allocation fully dynamic (remove limitation).
	 * Fix some annoying messages.
	 * Fix usage output of marsadm.
	 * Userspace: contributed bugfix for Debian udev rules by Jörg Mann.
	 * Improved debugging (only for testing).

light0.1beta0.18 (feature release)
--------
	 * New commands marsadm view-$macroname
	 * New customizable macro processor
	 * New err/warn/inf reporting via symlinks
	 * Per-resource emergency mode
	 * Allow limiting the sync parallelism
	 * New flood-protected syslogging
	 * Some smaller improvements
	 * Update docs
	 * Update test suite

light0.1beta0.17
--------
	 * Major bugfix: race in logfile switchover could sometimes
	   lead to the wrong logfile (extremely rare to hit, but
	   potentially harmful).
	 * Disallow primary switching when some secondaries are
	   syncing.
	 * Fix logfile fetch from multiple peers.
	 * Fix computation of transitive closure (affected
	   log-purge-all, split brain detection, and many others).
	 * Fix incorrect emergency mode detection.
	 * Primaries no longer fetch logfiles (unnecessarily, only
	   makes a difference at concurrent split brain operations).
	 * Detached resources no longer fetch logfiles (unexpectedly).
	 * Myriads of smaller fixes.
	
light0.1beta0.16
--------
	
	 * Critical bugfix: "marsadm primary --force" was assumed to be given
	   by sysadmins only in case of emergency, when the network is down.
	   When given in non-emergency cases where the old primary continues
	   to run (/dev/mars/* being actively used and written), the
	   old primary could suddendly do a "logrotate" to the
	   new split-brain logfile produced by the new (second) primary.
	   Now two primaries should be able to run concurrently in split-brain
	   mode without mutually trashing their logfiles.
	 * primary --force now only works in disconnected mode, in order
	   to hinder unintended forceful creation of split brain during
	   normal operation.
	 * Stop fetching of logfiles behind split brain points (save space
	   at the target hosts - usually the data will be discarded later).
	 * Fixed split brain detection in userspace.
	 * leave-resource now waits for local actions to take place
	   (remote actions stay asynchronously).
	 * invalidate / join-resource now work only if a designated primary
	   exists (otherwise they would not know uniquely from whom
	   to start initial sync).
	 * Update docs, clarify scenarios intended <-> emergengy switching.
	 * Fixed mutual overwrite of deletion symlinks in case of racing
	   log-deletes spawned in parallel by cron jobs (resilience).
	 * Fixed races between deletion and re-erection (e.g. fresh
	   join-resource after leave-resource during network partitions).
	 * Fixed duration of network timeouts in case the network is down
	   (replaced non-working TCP_KEEPALIVE by explicit timeouts).
	 * New option --dry-run which does not really create symlinks.
	 * New command "delete-resource" (VERY DANGEROUS) for
	   forcefully destroying a resource, even when it is in use.
	   Intended only for _emergency_ cases when sysadmins are
	   desperate. Use only by hand, first run with --dry-run in order
	   to check what will happen!
	 * New command "log-purge-all" (potentially DANGEROUS) for
	   resolving split brain in desperate situations (cleanup of
	   leftovers). Only use by hand, first run with --dry-run!
	 * Lots of smaller imprevements / usability / readability etc.
	 * Update test suite.
