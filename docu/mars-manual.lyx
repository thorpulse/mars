 MARS
\family default
 is a block-level storage replication system for long distances / flaky
 networks under GPL.
 It runs as a Linux kernel module.
 The sysadmin interface is similar to DRBD
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Registered trademarks are the property of their respective owner.
\end_layout

\end_inset

, but its internal engine is completely different from DRBD: it works with
 
\series bold
transaction logging
\series default
, similar to some database systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Therefore, MARS can provide stronger 
\series bold
consistency guarantees
\series default
.
 Even in case of network bottlenecks / problems / failures, the secondaries
 may become outdated (reflect an elder state), but never become inconsistent.
 In contrast to DRBD, MARS preserves the 
\series bold
order of write operations
\series default
 even when the network is flaky (
\series bold
Anytime Consistency
\series default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
The current version of MARS supports 
\begin_inset Formula $k>2$
\end_inset

 replicas and works 
\series bold
asynchronously
\series default
.
 Therefore, application performance is completely decoupled from any network
 problems.
 Future versions are planned to also support synchronous or near-synchronous
 modes.

Cost Arguments from Architecture
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Datacenters aren't usually operated for fun or for hobby.
 Costs are therefore a very important argument.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many enterprise system architects are starting with a particular architecture
 in mind, called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

big cluster
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 There is a common belief that otherwise 
\series bold
scalability
\series default
 could not be achieved:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename images/Architecure_Big_Cluster.pdf
	width 100col%

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
The crucial point is the storage network here: 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 frontend servers are interconnected with 
\begin_inset Formula $m=O(n)$
\end_inset

 storage servers, in order to achieve properties like scalability, failure
 tolerance, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 of the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 frontends must be able to access 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 of the 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 storages in realtime, the storage network must be dimensioned for 
\begin_inset Formula $O(n\cdot m)=O(n^{2})$
\end_inset

 network connections running in parallel.
 Even if the total network throughput would be scaling only with 
\begin_inset Formula $O(n)$
\end_inset

, the network has to 
\emph on
switch
\emph default
 the packets from 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 sources to 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 destinations (and their opposite way back) in 
\series bold
realtime
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This 
\series bold
cross-bar functionality
\series default
 in realtime makes the storage network expensive.
 Some further factors are increasing the costs of storage networks:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In order to limit error propagation from other networks, the storage network
 is often built as a 
\emph on
physically separate
\emph default
 / 
\emph on
dedicated
\emph default
 network.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Because storage networks are heavily reacting to high latencies and packet
 loss, they often need to be dimensioned for the 
\series bold
worst case
\series default
 (load peaks, packet storms, etc), needing one of the best = most expensive
 components for reducing latency and increasing throughput.
 Dimensioning to the worst case instead of an average case plus some safety
 margins is nothing but an expensive 
\series bold
overdimensioning
\series default
 / 
\series bold
over-engineering
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When multipathing is required for improving fault tolerance of the storage
 network itself, these efforts will even 
\series bold
double
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When geo-redundancy is required, the whole mess may easily more than double
 another time because in cases of disasters like terrorist attacks the backup
 datacenter must be prepared for taking over for multiple days or weeks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fortunately, there is an alternative called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sharding architecture
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which does not need a storage network at all, at least when built and dimension
ed properly.
 Instead, it 
\emph on
should have
\emph default
 (but not always needs) a so-called replication network which can, when
 present, be dimensioned much smaller because it does neither need realtime
 operations, nor scalabiliy to 
\begin_inset Formula $O(n^{2})$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename images/Architecure_Sharding.pdf
	width 100col%

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
Sharding architectures are extremely well suited when both the input traffic
 and the data is 
\series bold
already partitioned
\series default
.
 For example, when several thousands or even millions of customers are operating
 on disjoint data sets, like in web hosting where each webspace is residing
 in its own home directory, or when each of millions of mySQL database instances
 has to be isolated from its neighbour.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even in cases when any customer may potentially access any of the data items
 residing in the whole storage pool (e.g.
 like in a search engine), sharding can be often applied.
 The trick is to create some relatively simple content-based dynamic switching
 or redirect mechanism in the input network traffic, similar to HTTP load
 balancers or redirectors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Only when partitioning of input traffic plus data is not possible in a reasonabl
e way, big cluster architectures as implemented for example in Ceph or Swift
 (and partly even possible with MARS when resticted to the block layer)
 have their 
\series bold
usecase
\series default
.
 Only under such a precondition they are really needed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When sharding is possible, it is the preferred model due to cost and performance
 reasons.
\end_layout

\end_inset

Notice that MARS' new remote device feature from the 0.2 branch series (which
 is a replacement for iSCSI) 
\emph on
could
\emph default
 be used for implementing the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

big cluster
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 model at block layer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nevertheless, this sub-variant is not the preferred model.
 Following is the a super-model which combines both the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

big cluster
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and sharding model at block lyer in a very flexible way.
 The following example shows only two servers from a pool consisting of
 hundreds or thousands of servers:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename images/MARS_Cluster_on_Demand.pdf
	width 100col%

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
The idea is to use iSCSI or the MARS remote device 
\emph on
only where necessary
\emph default
.
 Preferably, local storage is divided into multiple Logical Volumes (LVs)
 via LVM, which are 
\emph on
directly
\emph default
 used 
\emph on
locally
\emph default
 by Virtual Machines (VMs), such as KVM or filesystem-based variants like
 LXC containers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the above example, the left machine has relatively less CPU power or
 RAM than storage capacity.
 Therefore, not 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 LVs could be instantiated locally at the same time without causing operational
 problems, but 
\emph on
some
\emph default
 of them can be run locally.
 The example solution is to 
\emph on
exceptionally(!)
\emph default
 export LV3 to the right server, which has some otherwise unused CPU and
 RAM capacity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that locally running VMs doesn't produce any storage network traffic
 at all.
 Therefore, this is the preferred runtime configuration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Only in cases of resource imbalance, such as (transient) CPU or RAM peaks
 (e.g.
 caused by DDOS attacks), 
\emph on
some
\emph default
 containers may be run somewhere else over the network.
 In a well-balanced and well-dimensioned system, this will be the 
\series bold
vast minority
\series default
, and should be only used for dealing with timely load peaks etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Running VMs directly on the same servers as their storage is a 
\series bold
major cost reducer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You simply don't need to buy and operate 
\begin_inset Formula $n+m$
\end_inset

 servers, but only about 
\begin_inset Formula $\max(n,m)+m\cdot\epsilon$
\end_inset

 servers, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 corresponds to some relative small extra resources needed by MARS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename images/lightbulb_brightlit_benj_.png
	lyxscale 12
	scale 7

\end_inset

In addition to this and to reduced networking costs, there are further cost
 savings at power consumption, air conditioning, Height Units (HUs), number
 of HDDs, operating costs, etc as explained below in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Cost-Arguments-from"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sharding model needs a different approach to load balancing of storage
 space than the big cluster model.
 There are serveral possibilities at different layers:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Dynamically growing the sizes of LVs via 
\family typewriter
lvresize
\family default

marsadm resize

\begin_layout Itemize

Moving whole LVs via MARS, as shown in the following example:

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename images/MARS_Background_Migration.pdf
	width 100col%

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
The idea is to dynamically create 
\emph on
additional
\emph default
 LV replicas for the sake of background migration.
 Examples:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In case you had no redundancy at LV level before, you have 
\begin_inset Formula $k=1$
\end_inset

 replicas during ordinary operation.
 If not yet done, you should transparently introduce MARS into your LVM-based
 stack by using the so-called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

standalone mode
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of MARS.
 When necessary, create the first MARS replica with 
\family typewriter
marsadm create-resource
\family default
 on your already-existing LV data, which is retained unmodified, and restart
 your application again.
 Now, for the sake of migration, you just create an additional replica at
 another server via 
\family typewriter
marsadm join-resource
\family default
 there and wait until the second mirror has been fully 
\series bold
synced
\series default
 in background, while your application is running and while the contents
 of the LV is modified 
\emph on
in parallel
\emph default
 by your ordinary applications.
 Then you do a primary 
\series bold
handover
\series default
 to your mirror.
 This is usually a matter of minutes, or even seconds.
 Once the application runs again at the new location, you can delete the
 old replica via 
\family typewriter
marsadm leave-resource
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
lvremove
\family default
.
 Finally, you may re-use the freed-up space for something else (e.g.
 
\family typewriter
lvresize
\family default
 of 
\emph on
another
\emph default
 LV followed by 
\family typewriter
marsadm resize
\family default
 followed by 
\family typewriter
xfs_growfs
\family default
 or similar).
 For the sake of some hardware lifecycle, you may run a different strategy:
 evacuate the original source server completely via the above MARS migration
 method, and eventually decommission it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In case you already have a redundant LV copy somewhere, you should run a
 similar procedure, but starting with 
\begin_inset Formula $k=2$
\end_inset

 replicas, and temporarily increasing the number of replicas to either 
\begin_inset Formula $k'=3$
\end_inset

 when moving each replica step-by-step, or you may even directly go up to
 
\begin_inset Formula $k'=4$
\end_inset

 when moving pairs at once.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When already starting with 
\begin_inset Formula $k>2$
\end_inset

 LV replicas in the starting position, you can do the same analogously,
 or you may then use a lesser variant.
 For example, we have some mission-critical servers at 1&1 which are running
 
\begin_inset Formula $k=4$
\end_inset

 replicas all the time on relatively small but important LVs for extremely
 increased safety.
 Only in such a case, you may have the freedom to temporarily decrease from
 
\begin_inset Formula $k=4$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $k'=3$
\end_inset

 and then going up to 
\begin_inset Formula $k''=4$
\end_inset

 again.
 This has the advantage of requiring less temporary storage space for 
\emph on
swapping
\emph default
 some LVs.

You can see that any self-built and self-administered storage (whose price
 varies with slower high-capacity versus faster low-capacity disks) is much
 cheaper than any commercial offering by about a factor of 10 or even more.
 If you need to operate serveral petabytes of data, self-built storage is
 always cheaper than commercial one, even if additional manpower would be
 needed for commissioning and operating.
 Here we just assume that the storage is needed permanently for at least
 5 years, as is the case in web hosting, databases, backup / archival systems,
 and many other application areas.

Cloud storage is way too much hyped.

\noindent
The crucial point is not only the number of extra servers needed for dedicated
 storage boxes, but also the total number of HDDs.
 While big cluster implementations like Ceph or Swift can 
\emph on
theoretically
\emph default
 use some erasure encoding for avoiding full object replicas, their 
\emph on
practice
\emph default
 as seen in our internal 1&1 Ceph clusters is similar to RAID-10, but just
 on objects instead of block-based sectors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore a big cluster typically needs >200% disks to reach the same net
 capacity as a sharded cluster, where typically hardware RAID-60 with a
 significantly smaller overhead is sufficient for providing sufficient failure
 tolerance at disk level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a surprising consequence from this: geo-redundancy is not as expensive
 as many people are believing.
 It just needs to be built with the proper architecture.
 A sharded geo-redundant pool based on hardware RAID-60 costs roughly about
 the same as (or when taking 
\begin_inset Formula $O(n^{2})$
\end_inset

 storage networks into account it is possibly even cheaper than) a big cluster
 with full replicas without geo-redundancy.
 A geo-redundant sharded pool provides even better failure compensation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that geo-redundancy implies by definition that an unforeseeable 
\series bold
full datacenter loss
\series default
 (e.g.
 caused by 
\series bold
disasters
\series default
 like a terrorist attack or an earthquake) must be compensated for 
\series bold
several days or weeks
\series default
.
 Therefore it is 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 sufficient to take a big cluster and just spread it to two different locations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In any case, a MARS-based geo-redundant sharding pool is cheaper than using
 commercial storage appliances which are much more expensive by their nature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Performance Arguments from Architecture
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some people think that replication is easily done at filesystem layer.
 There exist lots of cluster filesystems and other filesystem-layer solutions
 which claim to be able to replicate your data, sometimes even over long
 distances.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Trying to replicate several petabytes of data, or some billions of inodes,
 is however a much bigger challenge than many people can imagine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Choosing the wrong layer for 
\series bold
mass data replication
\series default
 may get you into trouble.
 Here is an explanation why replication at the block layer is more easy
 and less error prone:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
The picture shows the main components of a standalone Unix / Linux system.
 In the late 1970s / early 1980s, a so-called 
\series bold
Buffer Cache
\series default
 had been introduced into the architecture of Unix.
 Today's Linux has refined the concept to various internal caches such as
 the Page Cache and the Dentry Cache.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All these caches serve only one purpose: they are reducing the load onto
 the storage by exploitation of fast RAM.
 A well-tuned cache can yield high cache hit ratios, typically 99%.
 In some cases (as observed in practice) even more than 99.9%.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now start distributing the system over long distances.
 There are two potential cut points A and B.
 Cutting at A means replication at filesystem level.
 B means replication at block level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When replicating at A, you will notice that the caches are 
\emph on
below
\emph default
 your cut point.
 Thus you will have to re-implement 
\series bold
distributed caches
\series default
, and you will have to 
\series bold
maintain cache coherence
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When replicating at B, the Linux caches are 
\emph on
above
\emph default
 your cut point.
 Thus you will receive much less traffic, typically already reduced by a
 factor of 100, or even more.
 This is much more easy to cope with.
 You will also profit from 
\series bold
journalling filesystems
\series default
 like 
\family typewriter
ext4
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
xfs
\family default
.
 In contrast,

In this context, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 means that the POSIX semantics would be always guaranteed cluster-wide,
 and even in case of partial failures.
 In practice, some distributed filesystems like NFS don't even obey the
 POSIX standard 
\emph on
locally
\emph default
 on 1 standalone client.
 We know of projects which have 
\emph on
failed
\emph default
 right because of this.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\emph default
 journalling is typically not available with distributed cluster filesystems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A 
\emph on
potential
\emph default
 drawback of block layer replication is that you are typically limited to
 active-passive replication.
 An active-active operation is not impossible at block layer (see combinations
 of DRBD with 
\family typewriter
ocfs2
\family default
), but less common, and less safe to operate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This limitation isn't necessarily caused by the choice of layer.
 It is simply caused by the 
\series bold
laws of physics
\series default
: communication is always limited by the speed of light.
 A distributed filesystem is nothing else but a logically 
\series bold
distributed shared memory
\series default
 (DSM).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some decades of research on DSM have shown that there exist applications
 / workloads where the DSM model is 
\emph on
inferior
\emph default
 to the direct communication paradigm.
 Even in short-distance / cluster scenarios.
 Long-distance DSM is extremely cumbersome.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore: you simply shouldn't try to solve long-distance communication
 needs via communication over filesystems.
 Even simple producer-consumer scenarios (one-way communication) are less
 performant (e.g.
 when compared to plain TCP/IP) when it comes to distributed POSIX semantics.
 There is simply too much 
\series bold
synchronisation overhead at metadata level
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you have a need for mixed operations at different locations in parallel:
 just split your data set into disjoint filesystem instances (or database
 / VM instances, etc).
 All you need is careful thought about the 
\emph on
appropriate
\emph default
 
\emph on
granularity
\emph default
 of your data sets (such as well-chosen 
\emph on
sets
\emph default
 of user homedirectory subtrees, or database sets logically belonging together,
 etc).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Replication at filesystem level is often at single-file granularity.
 If you have several millions or even billions of inodes, you may easily
 find yourself in a snakepit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conclusion: active-passive operation over long distances (such as between
 continents) is even an advantage.
 It keeps you from trying bad / almost impossible things.

There exist some use cases where DRBD is clearly better than MARS.
 1&1 has a long history of experiences with DRBD where it works very fine,
 in particular coupling Linux devices rack-to-rack via crossover cables.
 DRBD is just 
\emph on
constructed
\emph default
 for that use case (RAID-1 over network).
 In such a scenario, DRBD is better than MARS because it uses up less disk
 space resources.
 In addition, newer DRBD versions can run over high-speed but short-distance
 interconnects like Infiniband (via the SDP protocol).
 Another use case for DRBD is active-active / dual-primary mode, e.g.
 
\family typewriter
ocfs2
\family default

\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Notice that 
\family typewriter
ocfs2
\family default
 is appearantly not constructed for long distances.
 1&1 has some experiences on a specific short distance cluster where the
 
\family typewriter
ocfs2
\family default
 / 
\family typewriter
DRBD
\family default
 combination scaled a little bit better than 
\family typewriter
NFS
\family default
, but worse than 
\family typewriter
glusterfs
\family default
 (using 2 clients in both cases -- notice that 
\family typewriter
glusterfs
\family default
 showed extremely bad performance when trying to enable active-active 
\family typewriter
glusterfs
\family default
 replication between 2 server instances, therefore we ended up using active-pass
ive DRBD replication below a single 
\family typewriter
glusterfs
\family default
 server).
 Conclusion: 
\family typewriter
NFS
\family default
 < 
\family typewriter
ocfs2
\family default
 < 
\family typewriter
glusterfs
\family default
 < sharding.
 We found that 
\family typewriter
glusterfs
\family default
 on top of active-passive DRBD scalability was about 2 times better than
 
\family typewriter
NFS
\family default
 on top of active-passive DRBD, while 
\family typewriter

\family default
 on top of

DRBD
\family default
 in active-active mode was somewhere inbetween.
 All cluster comparisons with an increasing workload over time (measured
 as number of customers which could be safely operated).
 Each system was replaced by the next one when the respective scalability
 was at its respective end, each time leading to operational problems.
 The ultimate solution was to replace all of these clustering concepts by

On the other hand, there exist other use cases where DRBD did not work as
 expected, leading to incidents and other operational problems.
 We analyzed them for our specific use cases.
 The later author of MARS came to the conclusion that they could only be
 resolved by fundamental changes in the overall architecture of DRBD.
 The development of MARS started at the personal initiative of the author,
 first in form of a personal project during holidays, but later picked up
 by 1&1 as an official project.

The simplified scenario is the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
DRBD is loaded with a low to medium, but constant rate of write operations
 for the sake of simplicity of the scenario.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The network has some throughput bottleneck, depicted as a red line.
 For the sake of simplicity, we just linearly decrease it over time, starting
 from full throughput, down to zero.
 The decrease is very slowly over time (some minutes, or even hours).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What will happen in this scenario?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As long as the actual DRBD write throughput is lower than the network bandwidth
 (left part of the horizontal blue line), DRBD works as expected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the maximum network throughput (red line) starts to fall short of the
 required application throughput (first blue dotted line), we get into trouble.
 By its very nature, DRBD works 
\series bold
synchronously
\series default
.
 Therefore, it 
\emph on
must
\emph default
 transfer all your application writes through the bottleneck, but now it
 is impossible
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This is independent from the DRBD protocols A through C, because it just
 depends on an information-theoretic argument independently from any protocol.
 We have a fundamental conflict between network capabilities and application
 demands here, which cannot be circumvented due to the 
\series bold
synchronous
\series default
 nature of DRBD.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 due to the bottleneck.
 As a consequence, the application running on top of DRBD will see increasingly
 higher IO latencies and/or stalls / hangs.
 We found practical cases (at least with former versions of DRBD) where
 IO latencies exceeded practical monitoring limits such as 
\begin_inset Formula $5$
\end_inset

 s by far, up to the range of 
\emph on
minutes
\emph default
.
 As an experienced sysadmin, you know what happens next: your application
 will run into an incident, and your customers will be dissatisfied.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to deal with such situations, DRBD has lots of tuning parameters.
 In particular, the 
\family typewriter
timeout
\family default
 parameter and/or the 
\family typewriter
ping-timeout
\family default
 parameter will determine when DRBD will give up in such a situation and
 simply drop the network connection as an emergency measure.
 Dropping the network connection is roughly equivalent to an automatic 
\family typewriter
disconnect
\family default
, followed by an automatic re-connect attempt after 
\family typewriter
connect-int
\family default
 seconds.
 During the dropped connection, the incident will appear as being resolved,
 but at some hidden cost
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
By appropriately tuning various DRBD parameters, such as 
\family typewriter
timeout
\family default
 and/or 
\family typewriter
ping-timeout
\family default
, you can keep the impact of the incident below some viable limit.
 However, the automatic disconnect will then happen earlier and more often
 in practice.
 Flaky or overloaded networks may easily lead to an enormous number of automatic
 disconnects.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What happens next in our scenario? During the 
\family typewriter
disconnect
\family default
, DRBD will record all positions of writes in its bitmap and/or in its activity
 log.
 As soon as the automatic re-connect succeeds after 
\family typewriter
connect-int
\family default
 seconds, DRBD has to do a partial re-sync of those blocks which were marked
 dirty in the meantime.

 LVM uses by default a BOW strategy (Backup On Write, which is the counterpart

 BOW increases IO latencies during ordinary operation.
 Retaining snapshots is cheap, but reverting them may be very costly, depending
 on workload.
 We didn't fully investigate that effect, and our experience is a few years

 Here is one point in favour of DRBD: MARS stores its transaction logs on
 the filesystem 
\family typewriter

\family default

 When the network bottleneck is lasting very long (some days or even some
 weeks), the filesystem will eventually run out of space some day.
 Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 discusses countermeasures against that in detail.
 In contrast to MARS, DRBD allocates its bitmap 
\emph on
statically
\emph default
 at resource creation time.
 It uses up less space, and you don't have to monitor it for (potential)
 overflows.
 The space for transaction logs is the price you have to pay if you want
 or need anytime consistency, or asynchronous replication in general.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to really grasp the

 of the difference between synchronous and asynchronous replication, we

In real life, many long-distance lines or even some heavily used metro lines

 As before, the application throughput served by MARS is assumed to be constant
 (dotted green line, often superseded by the solid green line).
 The actual replication network throughput is depicted by the solid green
 line.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As you can see, a network dropdown undershooting the application demand
 has no impact on the application throughput, but only on the replication
 network throughput.
 Whenever the network throughput is held back due to the flaky network,
 it simply catches up as soon as possible by overshooting the application
 throughput.
 The amount of lag-behind is visualized as shaded area: downward shading
 (below the application throughput) means an increase of the lag-behind,
 while the upwards shaded areas (beyond the application throughput) indicate
 a decrease of the lag-behind (catch-up).
 Once the lag-behind has been fully caught up, the network throughput suddenly
 jumps back to the application throughput (here visible in two cases).

 DRBD disconnect states, and in turn to DRBD inconsistent states of the
 secondary as long as the lag-behind has not been fully cought up.

Of course, this visualization is not exact.
 On one hand, the DRBD inconsistency phase may start later as depicted here,
 because it only starts 
\emph on
after

 the first automatic disconnect, upon the first automatic re-connect.
 In addition, the amount of resync data may be smaller than the amount of
 corresponding MARS transaction logfile data, because the DRBD bitmap will
 coalesce multiple writes to the same block into one single transfer.
 On the other hand, DRBD will transfer no data at all during its disconnected
 state, while MARS continues its best.
 This leads to a prolongation of the DRBD inconsistent phase.
 Depending on properties of the workload and of the network, the real duration
 of the inconsistency phase may be both shorter or longer.

In case of lag-behind, the version of the data replicated to the secondary
 site corresponds to some time in the past.
 Since the data is always transferred in the same order as originally submitted

 However, the

Conclusion: you can even use

 If you would try to do the same with DRBD, you could easily provoke a disaster.
 MARS simply tolerates any network problems, provided that there is enough
 disk space for transaction logfiles.
 Even in case of completely filling up your disk with transaction logfiles
 after some days or weeks, you will not lose local consistency anywhere

\begin_layout Standard

This time, the network throughput limit (solid red line) is assumed to be
 constant.
 However, the application workload (dotted green line) shows some heavy
 peaks.
 We know from our 1&1 datacenters that such an application behaviour is
 very common (e.g.
 in case of certain kinds of DDOS attacks etc).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the peaks are exceeding the network capabilities for some time, the
 replication network throughput (solid green line) will be limited for a
 short time, stay a little bit longer at the limit, and finally drop down
 again to the normal workload.
 In other words, you get a flexible buffering behaviour, coping with the
 peaks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similar scenarios (where both the application workload has peaks and the
 network is flaky to some degree) are rather common.
 If you would use DRBD there, you were likely to run into regular application
 performance problems and/or frequent automatic disconnect cycles, depending
 on the height and on the duration of the peaks, and on network resources.

\begin_layout Standard
Some people, often located at database operations, are obtrusively arguing

\begin_layout Standard
Anyone arguing this way has at least the following choices (list may be
 incomplete):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
None of the above use cases for MARS apply.
 For instance, short distance replication over crossover cables is sufficient
 (which occurs very often), or the network is reliable enough such that
 bottlenecks can never occur (e.g.
 because the total load is extremely low, or conversely the network is extremely
 overengineered / expensive), or the occurrence of bottlenecks can

 be taken into account.
 In such cases, DRBD is clearly the better solution than MARS, because it
 provides better actuality than the current version of MARS, and it uses
 up less disk resources.

 Many other solutions, even from commercial storage vendors, will not work

For low-cost storage, RAID-5 is no longer regarded safe for today's typical

 Therefore, use RAID-6.

MARS' tolerance of networking problems comes with some cost.
 You will need some extra space for the transaction logfiles of MARS, residing
 at the 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 filesystem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The exact space requirements for 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 depend on the 
\emph on
average write rate
\emph default
 of your application, not on the size of your data.
 We found that only few applications are writing more than 1 TB per day.
 Most are writing even less than 100 GB per day.
 Usually, you want to dimension 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 such that you can survive a network loss lasting 3 days / about one weekend.
 This can be achieved with current technology rather easily: as a simple
 rule of thumb, just use one 
\series bold
dedicated disk
\series default
 having a capacity of 4 TB or more.
 Typically, that will provide you with plenty of headroom even for bigger
 networking incidents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dedicated disks for 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 have another advantage: their mechanical head movement is completely independen
t from your data head movements.
 For best performance, attach that dedicated disk to your hardware RAID
 controller with BBU, building a separate RAID set (even if it consists
 only of a single disk -- notice that the 
\series bold
hardware BBU
\series default
 is the crucial point).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you are concerned about reliability, use two disks switched together
 as a relatively small RAID-1 set.
 For extremely high performance demands, you may consider (and check) RAID-10.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the transaction logfiles are highly sequential in their access pattern,
 a cheap but high-capacity SATA disk (or nearline-SAS disk) is usually sufficien

 At the time of this writing, standard SATA SSDs have shown to be

not
\emph default
 (yet) preferable.
 Although they offer high random IOPS rate, their sequential throughput
 is worse, and their long-term stability is questioned by many people at
 the time of this writing.

 in future.

 MARS assumes that it is running in a

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Currently, MARS provides no shared secret like DRBD, because a simple shared

This starts appending to a new logfile on all of your resources.

In contrast to DRBD, MARS distinguishes between 
\emph on
intended
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
forced
\emph default
 switching.
 This distinction is necessary due to differences in the communication architect
ure (asynchronous communication vs synchronous communication, see sections
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:The-Lamport-Clock"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "sec:The-Symlink-Tree"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Asynchronous communication means that (in worst case) a message may take
 (almost) arbitrary time in a distorted network to propagate to another
 node.
 As a consequence, the risk for accidentally creating an (unintended) split
 brain is increased (compared to a synchronous system like DRBD).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to minimize this risk, MARS has invested a lot of effort into an
 internal handover protocol when you start an 
\emph on

\begin_layout Standard
Before starting a planned handover from your old primary 
\family typewriter

\family default
 to a new primary 
\family typewriter
B
\family default
, you should check the replication of the resource.
 As a human, use 
\family typewriter
marsadm view mydata
\family default
.
 For scripting, use the macros from section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 (see also section

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 The network should be OK, and the amount of replication delay should be
 as low as possible.
 Otherwise, handover may take a very long time.

Best practice is to 
\series bold
prepare a planned handover
\series default
 by the following steps:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Check the network and the replication lag.
 It should be low (a few hundred megabytes, or a low number of gigabytes
 - see also the rough time forecast shown by 
\family typewriter
marsadm view mydata

 when there is a larger replication delay, or directly access the forecast
 by

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

When scripting, or when typing extremely fast, or for better safety, say
 
\family typewriter
marsadm wait-umount mydata

 When your network is OK, the propagation of the device usage state
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Notice that the usage check for 
\family typewriter
/dev/mars/mydata
\family default

\family default
 is based on the 
\emph on
open count
\emph default
 transferred from 
\emph on
another
\emph default
 node 
\family typewriter

 Since MARS is operating asynchronously (in contrast to DRBD), it may take
 some time until our node 
\family typewriter
B
\family default
 knows that the device is no longer used at 
\family typewriter
A
\family default
.
 This can lead to a race condition if you automate an intended takeover
 with a script like 
\family typewriter
ssh root@A 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

umount /dev/mars/mydata
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; ssh root@B 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

marsadm primary mydata
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\family default
 because your second ssh command may be faster than the internal MARS symlink
 tree propagation (cf section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:The-Symlink-Tree"

\end_inset

).
 In order to prevent such races, you are strongly advised to use the command
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
marsadm wait-umount mydata
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
on node 
\family typewriter

 See also section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 should take only a few seconds.
 Otherwise, check for any network problems or any other problems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
On host

\family typewriter
marsadm view mydata

 It is possible to omit this step, but then you have no control on the duration
 of the handover, and in case of any transfer problems, disk space problems,
 etc you are potentially risking to produce a split brain (although 
\family typewriter
marsadm
\family default

 Doing the wait by yourself, 
\emph on

 by re-mounting the device

/dev/mars/mydata
\family default
 at the old primary 
\family typewriter
A
\family default
 again, and by re-starting your application.
 Once you have started 
\family typewriter
marsadm primary
\family default
 on host 
\family typewriter

\family default

In contrast to DRBD, MARS remembers the designated primary, even when your

Some Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In contrast to DRBD, split brain situations are handled differently by MARS
 .
 When two primaries are accidentally active at the same time, each of them
 writes into different logfiles 
\family typewriter
/mars/resource-mydata/log-000000001-A
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
/mars/resource-mydata/log-000000001-B
\family default
 where the 
\emph on
origin
\emph default
 host is always recorded in the filename.
 Therefore, both nodes 
\emph on
can theoretically
\emph default
 run in primary mode independently from each other, at least for some time.
 They 
\emph on
might
\emph default
 even 
\family typewriter
log-rotate
\family default
 independently from each other.
 However, this is really no good idea.
 The replication to third nodes will likely get stuck, and your 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 filesystem(s) will eventually run out of space.
 Any further secondary node (when having 
\begin_inset Formula $k>2$
\end_inset

 replicas) will certainly get into serious problems: it simply does not
 know which split-brain version it should follow.
 Therefore, you will certainly loose the actuality of your redundancy.

 It tells the whole cluster that

\emph on
All

 Syncing is also not possible.
 When the device

 As soon as the local

 Split brain situations are detected

 by secondaries.
 Whenever a secondary detects that somewhere a split brain has happend,
 it refuses to replay any logfiles behind the split point (and also to fetch
 them when possible), or anywhere where something appears suspect or ambiguous.
 This tries to keep its local disk state always being consistent, but outdated
 with respect to any of the split brain versions.
 As a consequence, becoming primary may be impossible, because it cannot
 always know which logfiles are the correct ones to replay before 
\family typewriter
/dev/mars/mydata
\family default
 can appear.
 The ambiguity must be resolved first.

on
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

off
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 In addition, we have an actual response indicator, which is similar to
 an LED indicating the actual status.
 In our example, we imagine that both are used for controlling a big ventilator,
 having a huge inert mass.
 Imagine a big machine from a power plant, which is as tall as a human.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We start in a situation where the binary switch is off, and the ventilator
 is stopped.
 At point 1, we turn on the switch.
 At that moment, a big contactor will sound like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

zonggg
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and a big motor will start to hum.
 At first you won't hear anything else.
 It will take a while, say 1 minute, until the big wheel will have reached
 its final operating RPM, due to the huge inert mass.
 During that spin-up, the lights in your room will become slightly darker.
 When having reached the full RPM at point 2, your workplace will then be
 noisier, but in exchange your room lights will be back at ordinary strength,
 and the actual response LED will start to lit in order to indicate that
 the big fan is now operational.

Assume we want to turn the system off.
 When turning the todo switch to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 at point 3, first nothing will seem to happen at all.
 The big wheel will keep spinning due to its heavy inert mass, and the RPM
 as well as the sound will go down only slowly.
 During spin-down, the actual response LED will stay illuminated, in order
 to warn you that you should not touch the wheel, otherwise you may get
 injuried
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Standard
Upon submission of a write request on

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The temporary memory buffer serves multiple purposes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It keeps track of the order of write operations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Additionally, it keeps track of the positions in the underlying disk 
\family typewriter
/dev/lv-x/mydata
\family default
.
 In particular, it detects when the same block is overwritten multiple times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
During pending write operation, any concurrent reads are served from the
 memory buffer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After the write has been buffered in the temporary memory buffer, the main

\emph on
log entry
\emph default
 and starts an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

append
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 operation on the transaction logfile.
 The log entry contains vital information such as the logical block number
 in the underlying disk, the length of the data, a timestamp, some header
 magic in order to detect corruption, the log entry sequence number, of
 course the data itself, and optional information like a checksum or compression
 information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the log entry has been written through to the

 the writeback to the underlying disk

 Even when you power off the system right now, the information is not lost:
 it is present in the logfile, and can be reconstructed from there.
\end_layout

 a total order among the write requests which is

\begin_layout Standard
In case the primary node crashes during writeback, it suffices to replay
 the log entries from some point in the past until the end of the transaction
 logfile.
 It does no harm if you accidentally replay some log entries twice or even
 more often: since the replay is in the original total order, any temporary
 inconsistency is

 by the logfile application.

In mathematics, the property that you can apply your logfile twice to your
 data (or even as often as you want), is called

 This is a very desirable property: it ensures that nothing goes wrong when

The basic idea of the asynchronous replication of MARS is rather simple:
 just transfer the logfiles to your secondary nodes, and replay them onto
 their copy of the disk data (also called 
\emph on
mirror
\emph default
) in the same order as the total order defined by the primary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, a mirror of your data on any secondary may be outdated, but it
 always corresponds to some version which was valid in the past.
 This property is called 
\series bold
anytime consistency
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Your secondary nodes are always consistent in themselves.
 Notice that this kind of consistency is a 
\emph on
local

 consistency model.
 There exists no global consistency in MARS.
 Global consistency would be practically impossible in long-distance replication
 where Einstein's law of the speed of light is limiting global consistency.

As you can see in the picture, the process of transfering the logfiles is
 
\emph on
independent
\emph default
 from the process which replays the logfiles onto the data at some secondary
 site.
 Both processes can be switched on / off separately (see commands

 This may be

exploited

: for example, you may replicate your logfiles as soon as possible (to protect
 against catastrophic failures), but deliberately wait one hour until it
 is replayed (under regular circumstances).
 If your data inside your filesystem

 clock.
 MARS uses a special variant called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

physical Lamport clock
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The physical Lamport clock is another almost-realtime clock which 
\emph on
can
\emph default
 run independently from the Linux kernel system clock.
 However, the Lamport clock tries to remain as near as possible to the system
 clock.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both clocks can be queried at any time via 
\family typewriter
cat /proc/sys/mars/lamport_clock
\family default
.
 The result will show both clocks in parallel, in units of seconds since
 the Unix epoch, with nanosecond resolution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When there are no network messages at all, both the system clock and the
 Lamport clock will show almost the same time (except some minor differences
 of a few nanoseconds resulting from the finite processor clock speed).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The physical Lamport clock works rather simple: 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 message on the network is augmented with a Lamport time stamp telling when
 the message was 
\emph on
sent
\emph default
 according to the local Lamport clock of the sender.
 Whenever that message is received by some receiver, it checks whether the
 time ordering relation would be violated: whenever the Lamport timestamp
 in the message would claim that the sender had sent it 
\emph on
after
\emph default
 it arrived at the receiver (according to drifts in their respective local
 clocks), something must be wrong.
 In this case, the local Lamport clock of the 
\emph on
receiver
\emph default
 is advanced shortly after the sender Lamport timestamp, such that the time
 ordering relation is no longer violated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a consequence, any local Lamport clock may precede the corresponding
 local system clock.
 In order to avoid accumulation of deltas between the Lamport and the system
 clock, the Lamport clock will run slower after that, possibly until it
 reaches the system clock again (if no other message arrives which sets
 it forward again).
 After having reached the system clock, the Lamport clock will continue
 with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

normal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 speed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MARS uses the local Lamport clock for anything where other systems would
 use the local system clock: for example, timestamp generation in the 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 filesystem.
 Even symlinks created there are timestamped according to the Lamport clock.
 Both the kernel module and the userspace tool 
\family typewriter
marsadm
\family default
 are always operating in the timescale of the Lamport clock.
 Most importantly, all timestamp comparisons are always carried out with
 respect to Lamport time.

 Bigger differences between the Lamport and the system clock can be annoying
 from a human point of view: when typing 
\family typewriter
ls -l /mars/resource-mydata/
\family default
 many timestamps may appear as if they were created in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

future
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, because the 
\family typewriter
ls
\family default
 command compares the output formatting against the system clock (it does
 not even know of the existence of the MARS Lamport clock).

 Always use 
\family typewriter
ntp
\family default
 (or another clock synchronization service) in order to pre-synchronize
 your system clocks as close as possible.
 Bigger differences are not only annoying, but may lead some people to wrong
 conclusions and therefore even lead to bad human decisions!

The current

 Instead of being represented by symlinks, another representation will be

 A fundamentally different behaviour than DRBD: when your DRBD primary crashed
 some time ago, and now comes up again, you have to setup DRBD again by
 a sequence of commands like 
\family typewriter
modprobe drbd; drbdadm up all; drbdadm primary all
\family default
 or similar.
 In contrast, MARS needs only 
\family typewriter
modprobe mars
\family default
 (after 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 has been mounted by 
\family typewriter
/etc/fstab
\family default
).
 The 
\emph on
persistence
\emph default
 of the symlinks residing in 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 will automatically remember your previous state, even if some your resources
 were primary while others were secondary (mixed operations).
 You don't need to do any actions in order to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

restore
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 a previous state, no matter how 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

complex
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 it was.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Almost) all symlinks appearing in the 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 directory tree are automatically replicated thoughout the whole cluster,
 provided that the cluster 
\family typewriter
uuid
\family default
s are equal
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This is protection against accidental 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

merging
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of two unrelated clusters which had been created at different times with
 different 
\family typewriter
uuids
\family default
.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 at all sites.
 Thus the 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 directory forms some kind of 
\emph on
global namespace
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to avoid name clashes, each pathname created at node A follows
 a convention: the node name A should be a suffix of the pathname.
 Typically, internal MARS names follow the scheme 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\emph on
something
\emph default
/myname-A
\family default
.
 When using the expert command 
\family typewriter
marsadm {get,set}-link
\family default
 (which will likely be replaced by something else in future MARS releases),
 you should follow the best practice of systematically using pathnames like
 
\family typewriter
/mars/userspace/myname-A
\family default
 or similar.
 As a result, each node will automatically get informed about the state
 at any other node, like B when the corresponding information is recorded
 on node B under the name 
\family typewriter
/mars/userspace/myname-B
\family default
 (context-dependent names).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Graphics

\end_inset

 Experts only: the symlink replication works generically.
 You might use the 
\family typewriter
/mars/userspace/
\family default
 directory in order to place your own symlink there (for whatever purpose,
 which need not have to do with MARS).
 However, the symlinks are likely to disappear.
 Use 
\family typewriter
marsadm {get,set}-link
\family default
 instead.
 There is a chance that these abstract commands (or variants thereof) will
 be retained, by acting on the new data representation in future, even if
 the old symlink format will vanish some day.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Graphics

\end_inset

Important: the convention of placing the 
\series bold
creator host name
\series default
 inside your pathnames should be used wherever possible.
 The name part is a kind of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ownership indicator
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 It is crucial that no other host writes any symlink not 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

belonging
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to him.
 Other hosts may read foreign information as often as they want, but never
 modify them.
 This way, your cluster nodes are able to 
\emph on
communicate
\emph default
 with each other via symlink / information updates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although experts might create (and change) the current symlinks with userspace
 tools like 
\family typewriter
ln -s
\family default
, you should use the following marsadm commands instead:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
marsadm set-link myvalue /mars/userspace/mykey-A
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
marsadm delete-file /mars/userspace/mykey-A
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many reasons for this: first, the 
\family typewriter
marsadm set-link
\family default
 command will automatically use the Lamport clock for symlink creation,
 and therefore will avoid any errors resulting from a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

wrong
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 system clock (as in 
\family typewriter
ln -s
\family default
).
 Second, the 
\family typewriter
marsadm delete-file
\family default
 (which also deletes symlinks) works on the 
\emph on
whole cluster
\emph default
.
 And finally, there is a chance that this will work in future versions of
 MARS even after the symlinks have vanished.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What's the difference? If you would try to remove your symlink locally by
 hand via 
\family typewriter
rm -f
\family default
, you will be surprised: since the symlink has been replicated to the other
 cluster nodes, it will be re-transferred from there and will be resurrected
 locally after some short time.
 This way, you cannot delete any object reliably, because your whole cluster
 (which may consist of many nodes) remembers all your state information
 and will 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

correct
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 it whenever 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

necessary
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to solve the deletion problem, MARS uses some internal deletion
 protocol using auxiliary symlinks residing in 
\family typewriter
/mars/todo-global/.

\family default
 The deletion protocol ensures that all replicas get deleted in the whole
 cluster, and only thereafter the auxiliary symlinks in 
\family typewriter
/mars/todo-global/
\family default
 are also deleted eventually.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may update your already existing symlink via 
\family typewriter
marsadm set-link some-other-value /mars/userspace/mykey-A
\family default
 .
 The new value will be propagated throughout the cluster according to a
 
\series bold
timestamp comparison protocol
\series default
: whenever node B notices that A has a 
\emph on
newer
\emph default
 version of some symlink (according to the Lamport timestamp), it will replace
 its elder version by the newer one.
 The opposite does 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 work: if B notices that A has an elder version, just nothing happens.
 This way, the timestamps of symlinks can only progress in forward direction,
 but never backwards in time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a consequence, symlink updates made 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

by hand
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 via 
\family typewriter
ln -sf
\family default
 may get lost when the local system clock is much more earlier than the
 Lamport clock.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When your cluster is fully connected by the network, the last timestamp
 will finally win everywhere.
 Only in case of network outages leading to 
\emph on
network partitions
\emph default
, some information may be 
\emph on
temporarily inconsistent
\emph default
, but only for the duration of the network outage.
 The timestamp comparison protocol in combination with the Lamport clock
 and with the persistence of the 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 filesystem will automatically heal any temporary inconsistencies as soon
 as possible, even in case of temporary node shutdown.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The meaning of some internal MARS symlinks residing in 
\family typewriter

\family default
 will be hopefully documented in section

\begin_layout Standard
This section describes an important difference to DRBD.
 The metadata of DRBD is allocated 
\emph on
statically
\emph default
 at 
\emph on
creation
\emph default
 
\emph on
time
\emph default
 of the resource.
 In contrast, the MARS transaction logfiles are allocated 
\emph on
dynamically
\emph default
 at 
\emph on
runtime
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This leads to a potential risk from the perspective of a sysadmin: what
 happens if the 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 filesystem runs out of space?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No risk, no fun.
 If you want a system which survives long-lasting network outages while
 keeping your replicas always consistent (anytime consistency), you 
\emph on
need
\emph default
 dynamic memory for that.
 It is 
\emph on
impossible
\emph default
 to solve that problem using static memory
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The bitmaps used by DRBD don't preserve the 
\emph on
order
\emph default
 of write operations.
 They cannot do that, because their space is 
\begin_inset Formula $O(k)$
\end_inset

 for some constant 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 In contrast, MARS preserves the order.
 Preserving the order as such (even when only 
\emph on
facts
\emph default
 about the order were recorded without recording the actual data contents)
 requires 
\begin_inset Formula $O(n)$
\end_inset

 space where 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is infinitely growing over time.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, DRBD and MARS have different application areas.
 If you just want a simple system for mirroring your data over short distances
 like a crossover cable, DRBD will be a suitable choice.
 However, if you need to replicate over longer distances, or if you need
 higher levels of reliability even when multiple failures may accumulate
 (such as network loss during a 
\emph on
re
\emph default
sync of DRBD), the transaction logs of MARS can solve that, but at some
 
\emph on
cost

\begin_layout Standard
Motivation: in rare cases, some users with

ssh
\family default
 access can do 
\emph on
very
\emph default
 silly things.
 For example, some of them are creating their own backups via user-cron
 jobs, and they do it every 5 minutes.
 Some example guy created a zip archive (almost 1GB) by regularly copying
 his old zip archive into a new one, then appending deltas to the new one,
 and finally deleting the old archive.
 Every 5 minutes.
 Yes, every 5 minutes, although almost never any new files were added to
 the archive.
 Essentially, he copied over his archive, for nothing.
 This led to massive bulk write requests, for ridiculous reasons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, your hard disks (or even RAID systems) allow much higher write
 IO rates than you can ever transport over a standard TCP network from your
 primary site to your secondary, at least over longer distances (see use
 cases for MARS in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 is almost full and there is really absolutely no chance of getting rid
 of any local transaction logfile (or free some space in any other way),
 there is only one exit strategy: stop creating new logfile data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This means that the ability for replication gets lost.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When entering emergency mode, the kernel module will execute the following
 steps for all resources where the affected host is acting as a primary:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Do a kind of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

logrotate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but create a 
\emph on
hole
\emph default
 in the sequence of transaction logfile numbers.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

new
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 logfile is left empty, i.e.
 no data ist written to it (for now).
 The hole in the numbering will prevent any secondaries from replaying any
 logfiles behind the hole (should they ever contain some data, e.g.
 because the emergency mode has been left again).
 This works because the secondaries are regularly checking the logfile numbers
 for contiguity, and they will refuse to replay anything which is not contiguous.
 As a result, the secondaries will be left in a consistent, but outdated
 state (at least if they already were consistent before that).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The kernel module writes back all data present in the temporary memory buffer
 (see figure in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:The-Transaction-Logger"

\end_inset

).
 This may lead to a (short) delay of user write requests until that has
 finished (typically fractions of a second or a few seconds).
 The reason is that the temporary memory buffer must not be increased in
 parallel during this phase (race conditions).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
After the temporary memory buffer is empty, all local IO requests (whether
 reads or writes) are directly going to the underlying disk.
 This has the same effect as if MARS would not be present anymore.
 Transaction logging does no longer take place.

Expert advice for

 replicas: this means you had only 1 mirror per resource before the overflow
 happened.
 Provided that you have enough space on your LVMs and on

\family typewriter

 on a

third
\emph default

 Only after the initial full sync has finished there, run

at your original mirror.
 This way, you will always retain at least one

consistent mirror

 After all is up-to-date, you can delete the superfluous mirror by

 The problem is that you don't know whether the primary side has a silent

 This will

 Therefore, the underlying disk is only guaranteed to be consistent when

 Notice that this condition is racy by construction.
 When your primary node crashes during writeback and then comes up again,
 you must do a

Recall from chapter

 that MARS (in its current stage of development) does only guarantee local

 Notice that a general notion of

actuality

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Let's look at an example.
 In case of a node crash, and after the node is up again, a 
\family typewriter
modprobe mars
\family default
 has to occur, in order to replay the transaction logs of MARS again.
 However, at the recovery phase before, the journalling 
\family typewriter
ext4
\family default
 filesystem 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 
\emph on
may
\emph default
 have rolled back some internal symlink updates which have occurred immediately
 before the crash.
 MARS is relying on the fact that journalling filesystems like 
\family typewriter
ext4
\family default
 should do their recovery in a consistent way, possibly by sacrifycing actuality
 a little bit.
 Therefore, the above macros cannot guarantee to deliver true information
 about what is persisted at the moment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Notice that there are further potential caveats.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\family typewriter
{sync,fetch}-reached
\family default
, MARS uses 
\family typewriter
bio
\family default
 callbacks resp.
 
\family typewriter
fdatasync()
\family default
 by default, thus the underlying storage layer has 
\emph on
told
\emph default
 us that it 
\emph on
believes
\emph default
 it has commited the data in a reboot-safe way.
 Whether this is 
\emph on
really
\emph default
 true does not depend on MARS, but on the lower layers of the storage hierarchy.
 There exists hardware where this claim is known to be wrong under certain
 circumstances, such as certain hard disk drives in certain modes of operation.
 Please check the hardware for any violations of storage semantics under
 certain circumstances such as power loss, and check information sources
 like magazines about the problem area.
 Please notice that such a problem, if it exists at all, is independent
 from MARS.
 It would also exist if you wouldn't use MARS on the same system.

In order to create your own macros, you could start writing them from scratch
 with your favorite ASCII text editor.
 However, it is much easier to take an existing macro and to customize it
 to your needs.
 In addition, you can learn something about macro programming by looking
 at the existing macro code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Go to a new empty directory and say
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
marsadm dump-macros
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
in order to get the most interesting complex macros, or say
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
marsadm dump-all-macros
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
in order to additionally get some primitive macros which could be customized
 if needed.
 This will write lots of files 
\family typewriter
*.tpl
\family default
 into your current working directory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any modfied or new macro file should be placed either into the current working
 directory 
\family typewriter
./
\family default
 , or into 
\family typewriter
$HOME/.marsadm/
\family default
 , or into 
\family typewriter
/etc/marsadm/
\family default
 .
 They will be searched in this order, and the first match will win.
 When no macro file is found, the built-in version will be used if it exists.
 This way, you may override builtin macros.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Example: if you have a file 
\family typewriter
./mymacro.tpl
\family default
 you just need to say 
\family typewriter
marsadm view-mymacro mydata
\family default
 in order to invoke it in the resource context 
\family typewriter
mydata
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
General Macro Syntax
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Macros are simple ASCII text, enriched with calls to other macros.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ASCII text outside of comments are copied to the output verbatim.
 Comments are skipped.
 Comments may have one of the following well-known forms:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
# skipped text until / including next newline character
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
// skipped text until / including next newline character
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
/* skipped text including any newline characters */
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
denoted as Perl regex: 
\family typewriter

\backslash

\backslash

\backslash
n
\backslash
s* 
\family default
(single backslash directly followed by a newline character, and eating up
 any whitespace characters at the beginning of the next line) Hint: this
 may be fruitfully used to structure macros in a more readable form / indentatio
n.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Special characters are always initiated by a backslash.
 The following pre-defined special character sequences are recognized:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter

\backslash
n
\family default
 newline
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter

\backslash
r
\family default
 return (useful for DOS compatibility)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter

\backslash
t
\family default
 tab
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter

\backslash
f
\family default
 formfeed
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter

\backslash
b
\family default
 backspace
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter

\backslash
a
\family default
 alarm (bell)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter

\backslash
e
\family default
 escape (e.g.
 for generating ANSI escape sequences)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter

\backslash

\family default
 followed by anything else: assure that the next character is taken verbatim.
 Although possible, please don't use this for escaping letters, because
 further escape sequences might be pre-defined in future.
 Best practice is to use this only for escaping the backslash itself, or
 for escaping the percent sign when you don't want to call a macro (protect
 against evaluation), or to escape a brace directly after a macro call (verbatim
 brace not to be interpreted as a macro parameter).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
All other characters stand for their own.
 If you like, you should be able to produce XML, HTML, JSON and other ASCII-base
d output formats this way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Macro calls have the following syntax:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
%
\emph on
macroname
\emph default
{
\emph on
arg1
\emph default
}{
\emph on
arg2
\emph default
}{
\emph on
argn
\emph default
}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Of course, arguments may be empty, denoted as 
\family typewriter
{}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It is possible to supply more arguments than required.
 These are simply ignored.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There must be always at least 1 argument, even for parameterless macros.
 In such a case, it is good style to leave it empty (even if it is actually
 ignored).
 Just write 
\family typewriter
%parameterlessmacro{}
\family default
 in such a case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
%{
\emph on
varname
\emph default
}
\family default
 syntax: As a special case, the macro name may be empty, but then the first
 argument must denote a previously defined variable (such as assigned via
 
\family typewriter
%let{varname}{myvalue}
\family default
, or a pre-defined standard variable like 
\family typewriter
%{res}
\family default
 for the current resource name, see later paragraph 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "par:Predefined-Variables"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Of course, parameter calls may be (almost) arbitrarily nested.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Of course, the 
\emph on
correctness
\emph default
 of nesting of braces must be generally obeyed, as usual in any other macro
 processor language.
 General rule: for each opening brace, there must be exactly one closing
 brace somewhere afterwards.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These rules are hopefully simple and intuitive.
 There are currently no exceptions.
 In particular, there is no special infix operator syntax for arithmetic
 expressions, and therefore no operator precedence rules are necessary.
 You have to write nested arithmetic expressions always in the above prefix
 syntax, like 
\family typewriter
%*{7}{%+{2}{3}}
\family default
 (similar to non-inverse polish notation).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename images/lightbulb_brightlit_benj_.png
	lyxscale 12
	scale 7

\end_inset

When deeply nesting macros and their braces, you may easily find yourself
 in a feeling like in the good old days of Lisp.
 Use the above backslash-newline syntax to indent your macros in a readable
 and structured way.
 Fortunately, modern text editors like (x)emacs or vim have modes for dealing
 with the correctness of nested braces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Calling Builtin / Primitive Macros
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Primitive macros can be called in two alternate forms:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
%primitive-
\emph on
macroname
\emph default
{
\emph on
something
\emph default
}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
%
\emph on
macroname
\emph default
{
\emph on
something
\emph default
}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When using the 
\family typewriter
%primitive-*{}
\family default
 form, you 
\emph on
explicitly disallow
\emph default
 interception of the call by a 
\family typewriter
*.tpl
\family default
 file.
 Otherwise, you may override the standard definition even of primitive macros
 by your own template files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename images/MatieresCorrosives.png
	lyxscale 50
	scale 17

\end_inset

 Notice that 
\family typewriter
%call{}
\family default
 conventions are used in such a case.
 The parameters are passed via 
\family typewriter
%{0}
\family default
 
\begin_inset Formula $\ldots$
\end_inset


\family typewriter
%{n}
\family default
 variables (see description below).
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These are already described in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Predefined-Trivial-Macros"

\end_inset

.
 When calling one of them, the call will simply expand to the corresponding
 value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Example: 
\family typewriter
%get-primary{}
\family default
 will expand to the hostname of the current designated primary node.

 This is for simplification of boring if-else-if chains.
 The classical if-syntax (as shown above) has the drawback that inner if-parts
 need to be nested into outer else-parts, so rather deep nestings may occur
 when you are programming longer chains.
 This is an alternate syntax for avoidance of deep nesting.
 When giving an odd number of arguments, the last argument is taken as final
 else-part.

\begin_layout Standard
Both the

asynchronous communication model
\series default
 of MARS (cf section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

) including the Lamport clock, and the 
\series bold
state model
\series default
 (cf section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:The-State-of"

\end_inset

) is something you 
\emph on
definitely
\emph default
 should have in mind when you want to do some scripting.
 Here is some further concrete advice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Don't access anything on 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 directly, except for debugging purposes.
 Use 
\family typewriter
marsadm
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Avoid running scripts in parallel, other than for inspection / monitoring
 purposes.
 When you give two 
\family typewriter
marsadm
\family default
 commands in parallel (whether on the same host, or on different hosts belonging
 to the same cluster), it is very likely to produce a mess.
 
\family typewriter
marsadm
\family default
 has no internal locking.
 There is no cluster-wide locking at all.
 Unfortunately, some systems like Pacemaker are violating this in many cases
 (depending on their configuration).
 Best is if you have a dedicated / more or less centralized 
\series bold
control machine
\series default
 which controls masses of your georedundant working servers.
 This reduces the risk of running interfering actions in parallel.
 Of course, you need backup machines for your control machines, and in different
 locations.
 Not obeying this advice can easily lead to problems such as complex races
 which are very difficult to solve in long-distance distributed systems,
 even in general (not limited to MARS).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
marsadm wait-cluster
\family default
 is your friend.
 Whenever your (near-)central script has to switch between different hosts
 
\family typewriter
A
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
B
\family default
 (of the same cluster), use it in the following way:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\family typewriter
ssh A 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

marsadm action1
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; ssh B 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

marsadm wait-cluster; marsadm action2

 Don't ignore this advice! Interference is almost 
\emph on

\emph default
! As a rule of thumb, precede almost any action command with some appropriate
 waiting command!

Common precondition for all resource operations is that the 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 filesystem is mounted, that it contains a valid MARS symlink tree produced
 by other 
\family typewriter
marsadm
\family default
 commands (including a unique 
\family typewriter
uuid
\family default
), that your current node is a valid member of the cluster, and that the
 kernel module is loaded.
 When communication is impossible due to network outages or bad firewall
 rules, most commands will succeed, but other cluster nodes may take a long
 time to notice your changes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instead of executing 
\family typewriter
marsadm
\family default
 commands serveral times for each resource argument, you may give the special
 resource argument 
\family typewriter
all
\family default
.
 This work even when combined with 
\family typewriter
--force
\family default

\family typewriter
marsadm delete-resource --force all
\family default

 In some very rare cases, like final destruction of a whole datacenter after

 Don't use such combinations if you don't need them

\size scriptsize
Use this only in desperate situations, and only manually.
 Don't call this from scripts.
 You are forcefully using a sledgehammer, even without

\family default
! The danger is that the 
\emph on

 state of other cluster nodes need not be known in case of network problems

byzantine failures
\series default

\end_layout

\size scriptsize
It is strongly advised to try this command with

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\size scriptsize
When combined with 
\family typewriter
--force
\family default
, this command will definitely 
\series bold
murder
\series default
 other cluster nodes, possibly after a long while, and even when they are
 operating in primary mode / having split brains / etc.
 However, there is no guarantee that other cluster nodes will be 
\emph on
really
\emph default
 dead -- it is (theoretically) possible that they remain only 
\emph on
half
\emph default
 
\emph on
dead
\emph default

 For example, a half dead node may continue to write data to

This command implies a forceful detach, possibly destroying consistency.
 
\size scriptsize
It is similar in spirit to a 
\series bold
STONITH
\series default
.
 In particular, when a cluster node was operating in primary mode (
\family typewriter
/dev/mars/mydata
\family default
 being continuously in use), the forceful detach cannot be carried out until
 the device is completely unused.
 In the meantime, the current transaction logfile will be appended to, but
 the file 
\emph on
might
\emph default
 be already unlinked (orphan file filling up the disk).
 After the forceful detach, the underlying disk need not be consistent (although
 MARS does its best).
 Since this command deletes any symlinks which normally would indicate the
 consistency state, no guarantees about consistency can be given after this
 
\emph on
in general
\emph default
! Always check consistency by hand!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\size scriptsize
When possible / as soon as possible, check the local state on the other
 nodes in order to 
\emph on
really
\emph default
 shutdown the resource everywhere (e.g.
 to 
\emph on
really
\emph default
 unuse the 
\family typewriter
/dev/mars/mydata
\family default
 device, etc).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\size scriptsize
After this command, you 
\emph on
should
\emph default
 rebuild the resource under a different name, in order to avoid any clashes
 caused by unexpected resurrection of

dead
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

half-dead

 nodes (beware of shapshot / restores on virtual machines!!).
 MARS does its best to avoid problems even in case the new resource name
 should equal the old one, but there can be 
\emph on
no guarantee
\emph default
 in all possible failure scenarios / usage scenarios.

In contrast to DRBD, you need not explicitly pause syncing, fetching, or
 replaying 
\emph on
to
\emph default
 (as apposed to 
\emph on
from
\emph default
) the local disk.
 These processes are automatically paused.
 As another contrast to DRBD, the respective processes will usually 
\emph on
automatically
\emph default
 resume after re-attach, as far as possible in the respective new situation.
 This will usually work even over 
\family typewriter
rmmod
\family default
 or reboot cycles, since the internal symlink tree will automatically persist
 all todo switches for you (c.f.

Notice: only

 transfer operations 
\emph on
to

 the local disk are paused by a detach.
 When another node is remotely running a sync 
\emph on
from
\emph default
 your local disk, it will likely remain in use for remote reading.
 The reason is that the server part of MARS is operating purely passively,
 in order serve all remote requests as best as possible (similar to the
 original Unix philosophy).
 In order to really stop all accesses, do a 
\family typewriter
pause-sync
\family default
 on all other resource member where a sync is currently running.
 You may also try 
\family typewriter
pause-sync-global
\family default

Note: although this sounds similar to DRBD's 
\family typewriter
drbdadm connect
\family default
, there are subtle differences.
 DRBD has exactly one connection per resource, which is associated with
 
\emph on
pairs
\emph default
 of nodes.
 In contrast, MARS may create multiple connections per resource at runtime,
 and these are associated with the 
\emph on
target
\emph default
 host (not with 
\emph on
pairs
\emph default
 of hosts).
 As a consequence, the fetch may 
\emph on
potentially
\emph default
 occur from any other other source host which happens to be reachable (although
 the current implementation prefers the current designated primary, but
 this may change in future).
 In addition, 
\family typewriter
marsadm disconnect
\family default
 does not stop 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 communication.
 It only stops fetching logfiles.
 The symlink update running in background is 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 stopped, in order to always propagate as much metadata as possible in the
 cluster.
 In case of a later incident, chances are higher for a better knowledge
 of the 
\emph on
real
\emph default
 state of the cluster.

A common misconception is when people think that they can keep their filesystem
 mounted without provoking a split brain, because they have their application
 stopped and thus don't write any data into the filesystem.
 This is a wrong idea, because filesystems may write some metadata, like
 booking information, even after hours or days of inactivity.
 Therefore MARS insists that the device is no longer in use before any handover
 can take place.

 be impossible becoming the / an actual primary.
 Typically you may be

 in a split brain situation.
 This has not been observed for a long operations time on recent versions

--force
\family default
 cannot be guaranteed always, although MARS does its best.
 In split brain situations, or if you ever encounter such a problem, you
 
\emph on
must
\emph default
 resolve the split brain immediately after giving this command (see section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "sub:Split-Brain-Resolution"

 Hint in case of

\end_inset

 replicas: 
\family typewriter
marsadm invalidate
\family default
 cannot always resolve a split brain at other secondaries (which are neither
 the old nor the new designated primary).
 Therefore, prefer the 
\family typewriter
leave-resource
\family default
 method described in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Split-Brain-Resolution"

\end_inset

, starting with a 
\family typewriter
leave-resource
\family default
 phase at the old primary, and proceeding to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

unrelated
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 secondaries step by step, until the split brain is gone.
 Don't 
\family typewriter
join-resource
\family default
 again before the split brain is gone! This way, all these replicas will
 remain consistent for now, but of course outdated (or potentially even
 a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

wrong
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 split-brain version, but 
\emph on
potentially usable
\emph default
 in case you get under pressure in some way).
 In the hopefully unlikely case that you should later discover that you
 accidentally forced the 
\emph on
wrong
\emph default
 replica via 
\family typewriter
primary --force
\family default
, you will have a chance to recover by either forcing the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_inset

 host to primary (if it did not already leave the resource), or by creating
 a completely fresh resource out of the

 Generally: in case of

primary --force

 The fetch

 be switched off (see

 Notice: in difference to DRBD, you

 this command during normal operation, including handover.
 Any resource member which is

not

 designated as primary will

 go into secondary role.
 For example, if you have

 replicas, only

one of them
\emph default
 can be designated as a primary.
 When the network is OK, all other 3 nodes will know this fact, and they

A serious 
\series bold
misconception
\series default
 among some people is when they believe that they can switch 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

a certain node to secondary
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 It is not possible to switch individual nodes to secondary, without affecting
 other nodes! The concept of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

designated primary
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is 
\series bold
global
\series default
 throughout a resource!
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 You cannot start a sync after that (e.g.
 
\family typewriter
invalidate
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
join-resource
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
resume-sync
\family default
), because it is 
\emph on
not unique
\emph default
 wherefrom the data shall be fetched.
 In split brain situations (when the network is OK again), this may have
 further drawbacks.
 It is much better / easier to 
\series bold
\emph on
directly
\emph default
 switch the designated primary
\series default
 from one node to another via the 
\family typewriter
primary
\family default
 command.

In many case, you will not need to deal with tweaks in

 This means, the values will be reset to default at

\begin_layout Subsection
Tuning Network Performance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Starting with MARS Light series 0.2, a new feature called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

socket bundling
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is available.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is mostly intendend for lines showing high packet loss.
 By using multiple TCP sockets in parallel for emulating a single logical
 connection, throughput can be significantly increased.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Example for setting the socket parallelism to 4:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
echo 4 > /proc/sys/mars/parallel_connections
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following graphics shows the throughput of a non-fast

\end_layout

\end_inset

 fullsync of a 
\emph on
single
\emph default
 100GiB resource over a loaded long-distance line between Europe/Germany
 and USA/Midwest.
 In order to compensate highly varying load at the line, all the experiments
 were repeated more than 10 times and averaged.
 Each bar shows the throughput for a particular socket parallelism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
Notice that the uplinks of the two servers are only 1 GBit/s respectively.
 When the uplink is saturated, about 100 MByte/s is the maximum possible
 peak throughput in theory.
 You can easily recognize that the peak throughput is almost reached with
 a parallelism degree of 2, but using even more sockets appears to be slightly
 counter-productive.
 One of the reasons is that more sockets will increase contention on the
 line, and thus increasing packet loss.
 Another potential reason is that higher parallelism at sockets will lead
 to higher parallelism in disk reads, in turn leading to more permutations
 of disk read positions (more 
\emph on
random
\emph default
 reads instead of purely sequential reads), which is counter-productive
 for disk readahead strategies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next graphics shows the same, but over a medium distance of about 50km.
 This line is even more heavily loaded with respect to the number of TCP
 connections running in parallel (probly some 10,000 or even 100,000 if
 not more), and there is some kind of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

traffic shaping
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 at some intermediate network gear which will 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

punish
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 those traffic sources disproportionally increasing overall packet loss.
 This can explain the even higher counter-productive effect of using too
 much sockets and thus injecting additional packet loss:

In general, the optimum value for 
\family typewriter
/proc/sys/mars/parallel_connections
\family default
 may depend on many runtime factors such as other load running over some
 (parts of) physical equipment.
 You will need to determine optimum values yourself.

 If you are operating masses of servers, don't set the MARS socket parallelism

too high

everywhere.
 You might 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

steal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 too much bandwidth from other applications when starting masses of syncs
 in parallel, e.g.
 after an incident.
 Best practice is to start with a default value of 1, and to increase it
 only 
\emph on

\emph default
, and/or preferably 
\emph on

 at those servers where high load really occurs or where some urgent actions

Logging to Files
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This feature will likely disappear when MARS goes to kernel upstream.
 It was mostly intended for debugging during early beta phases and is no
 longer needed for stable operation.
 Developers may use it for spotting potential problems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The classes may be used to produce status files 
\family typewriter
$class.*.status
\family default
 in the 
\family typewriter

 and/or in the 
\family typewriter
/mars/resource-

\begin_layout Standard
When you create a file 
\family typewriter
$class.*.log
\family default
 in parallel to any 
\family typewriter
$class.*.status
\family default
, the 
\family typewriter
*.log
\family default
 file will be appended forever with the same messages as in 
\family typewriter
*.status
\family default
.
 The difference is that *.status is regenerated anew from an empty starting
 point, while *.log can (potentially) increase indefinitely unless you remove
 it, or rename it to something else.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Logging to Syslog
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The classes also play a role in the following 
\family typewriter
/proc/sys/mars/
\family default
 tweaks:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

\family typewriter
syslog_min_class
\family default
 (rw) The 
\emph on
mimimum
\emph default
 class number for 
\emph on
permanent
\emph default
 syslogging.
 By default, this is set to -1 in order to switch off perment logging completely.
 Permament logging can easily flood your syslog with such huge amounts of
 messages (in particular when class=0), that your system as a whole may
 become unusable (because vital kernel threads may be blocked too long or
 too often by the userspace syslog daemon).
 Instead, please use the flood-protected syslogging described below!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

\family typewriter
syslog_max_class
\family default
 (rw) The 
\emph on
maximum
\emph default
 class number for 
\emph on
permanent
\emph default
 syslogging.
 Please use the flood-protected version instead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

\family typewriter
syslog_flood_class
\family default
 (rw) The mimimum class of flood-protected syslogging.
 The maximum class is always 4.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

\family typewriter
syslog_flood_limit
\family default
 (rw) The maxmimum number of messages after which the flood protection will
 start.
 This is a hard limit for the the number of messages written to the syslog.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

\family typewriter
syslog_flood_recovery_s
\family default
 (rw) The number of seconds after which the internal flood counter is reset
 (after flood protection state has been reached).
 When no new messages appear after this time, the flood protection will
 start over at count 0.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename images/lightbulb_brightlit_benj_.png
	lyxscale 12
	scale 7

\end_inset

The rationale behind flood protected syslogging: sysadmins are usually only
 interested in the point in time where some problems / incidents / etc have
 
\emph on
started
\emph default
.
 They are usually not interested in capturing 
\emph on
each
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
every
\emph default
 single error message (in particular when they are flooding the system logs).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename images/lightbulb_brightlit_benj_.png
	lyxscale 12
	scale 7

\end_inset

If you 
\emph on
really
\emph default
 need complete error information, use the 
\family typewriter
*.log
\family default
 files described above, compress them and save them to somewhere else 
\emph on
regularly
\emph default
 by a cron job.
 This bears much less overhead than filtering via the syslog daemon, or
 even remote syslogging in real time which will almost surely screw up your
 system in case of network problems co-inciding with flood messages, such
 as caused in turn by those problems.
 Don't rely on real-time concepts, just do it the old-fashioned batch job
 way.

\begin_layout Subsection
Tuning the Sync
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

\family typewriter
sync_flip_interval_sec
\family default
 (rw) The sync process must not run in parallel to logfile replay, in order
 to easily guarantee consistency of your disk.
 If logfile replay would be paused for the full duration of very large or
 long-lasting syncs (which could take some days over very slow networks),
 your 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 filesystem could overflow because no replay would be possible in the meantime.
 Therefore, MARS regulary flips between actually syncing and actually replaying,
 if both is enabled.
 You can set the time interval for flipping here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

\family typewriter
sync_limit
\family default
 (rw) When > 0, this limits the maximum number of sync processes actually
 running parallel.
 This is useful if you have a large number of resources, and you don't want
 to overload the network with sync processes.
\end_layout

The most important property of shared-disk is that there exists only a single

 Nowadays, this disk often has some

 It should be immediately clear that shared-disk clusters are only suitable
 for short-distance operations in the same datacenter.
 Although running one of the data access lines over short distances between
 very near-by datacenters (e.g.

\begin_layout Subsection
Handover / Failover Reasons and Scenarios
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From a sysadmin perspective, there exist a number of different

reasons
\series default
 why the application workload must be switched from the currently active
 side A to the currently passive side B:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Some 
\series bold
defect
\series default
 has occurred at cluster side A or at some corresponding part of the network.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Some 
\series bold
maintenance
\series default
 has to be done at side A which would cause a longer downtime (e.g.
 security kernel update or replacement of core network equipment or maintainance
 of UPS or of the BBU cache etc - hardware isn't 24/7/365 in practice, although
 some vendors 
\emph on
claim
\emph default
 it - it is either not really true, or it becomes 
\emph on
extremely
\emph default
 expensive).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both reasons are valid and must be automatically handled in larger installations.
 In order to deal with all of these reasons, the following basic mechanisms
 can be used in either model:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

Failover

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to not confuse handover with failover at concept level.
 Not only the reasons / preconditions are very different, but also the 
\emph on
requirements
\emph default
.
 Example: precondition for handover is that 
\emph on
both
\emph default
 cluster sides are healthy, while precondition for failover is that 
\emph on
some relevant(!)
\emph default
 failure has been 
\emph on
detected
\emph default
 somewhere (whether this is 
\emph on
really
\emph default
 true is another matter).
 Typically, failover must be able to run in masses, while planned handover
 often has lower scaling requirements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not all existing clustermanagers are dealing with all of these cases (or
 their variants) equally well, and some are not even dealing with some of
 these cases / variants 
\emph on
at all
\emph default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some clustermanagers cannot easily express the concept of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

automatic triggering
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset Quotes eld

 There exists simply no cluster-global switch which selects either

manual mode
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

automatic mode
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (except when you start to hack the code and/or write new plugins; then
 you might notice that there is almost no architectural layering / sufficient
 separation between mechanism and strategy).
 Being forced to permanently use an automatic mode for several hundreds
 or even thousands of clusters is not only boring, but bears a considerable
 risk when automatics do a wrong decision at hundreds of instances in parallel.

 suggests.
 However, when running several hundreds or thousands of cluster instances,

 In addition, failover should

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Please consider the following: when it comes to long-distance HA, the above
 layering architecture is also motivated by vastly different numbers of
 instances for each layer.
 Ideally, the topmost automatics layer should be able to overview several
 datacenters in parallel, in order to cope with (almost) global network
 problems such as network partitions.
 Additionally, it should also detect single cluster failures, or intermediate
 problems like

rack failure

\begin_layout Paragraph
STONITH-like Methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
STONITH = Shoot The Other Node In The Head
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These methods are widely known, although they have several serious drawbacks.
 Some people even believe that 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 clustermanager must 
\emph on
always
\emph default
 have some STONITH-like functionality.
 This is wrong.
 There 
\emph on
exist
\emph default
 alternatives, as shown in the next paragraph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most obvious drawback is that STONITH will always create a 
\series bold
damage
\series default
, by definition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Example: a typical contemporary STONITH implementation uses IPMI for automatical
ly powering off your servers, or at least pushes the (virtual) reset button.
 This will 
\emph on
always
\emph default
 create a certain type of damage: the affected systems will definitely not
 be available, at least for some time until they have (manually) rebooted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a conceptual contradiction: the reason for starting failover is
 that you want to restore availability as soon as possible, but in order
 to do so you will first 
\emph on
destroy
\emph default
 the availability of a particular 
\emph on
component
\emph default
.
 This may be counter-productive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Example: when your hot standby node B does not work as expected, or if it
 works even 
\emph on
worse
\emph default
 than A before, you will loose some time until you 
\emph on
can
\emph default
 become operational again at the old side A.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here is an example method for handling a failure scenario.
 The old active side A is assumed to be no longer healthy anymore.
 The method uses a sequential state transition chain with a STONITH-like
 step:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Phase1 Check whether the hot standby B is currently usable.
 If this is violated (which may happen during certain types of disasters),
 abort the failover for any affected resources.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Phase2 
\emph on
Try
\emph default
 to shutdown the damaged side A (in the 
\emph on
hope
\emph default
 that there is no 
\emph on
serious
\emph default
 damage).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Phase3 In case phase2 did not work during a grace period / after a timeout,
 assume that A is badly damaged and therefore STONITH it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Phase4 Start the application at the hot standby B.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice: any cleanup actions, such as 
\series bold
repair
\series default
 of defective hard- or software etc, are outside the scope of failover processes.
 Typically, they are executed much later when restoring redundancy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also notice: this method is a 
\emph on
heavily
\emph default
 distributed one, in the sense that sequential actions are alternated multiple
 times on different hosts.
 This is known to be cumbersome in distributed systems, in particular in
 presence of network problems.

Phase4 in more detail for DRBD, augmented with some pseudo code for application

\begin_layout Enumerate
at side B:

\begin_layout Enumerate

\begin_layout Standard
The same phase4 using MARS:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
at side B: 
\family typewriter
marsadm pause-fetch all
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
at side B: 
\family typewriter
marsadm primary --force all
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
at side B: 
\family typewriter
applicationmanager start all
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This sequential 4-phase method is far from optimal, for the following reasons:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The method tries to handle both failover and handover scenarios with one
 single sequential receipe.
 In case of a true failover scenario where it is 
\emph on
already known for sure
\emph default
 that side A is badly damaged, this method will unnecessarily waste time
 for phase 2.
 This could be fixed by introduction of a conceptual distinction between
 handover and failover, but it would not fix the following problems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Before phase4 is started (which will re-establish the service from a user's
 perspective), a lot of time is wasted by 
\emph on
both
\emph default
 phases 2 
\emph on
and
\emph default
 3.
 Even if phase 2 would be skipped, phase 3 would unnecessarily cost some
 time.
 In the next paragraph, an alternative method is explained which eliminates
 any unnecessary waiting time at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The above method is adapted to the shared-disk model.
 It does not take advantage of the shared-nothing model, where further possibili
ties for better solutions exist.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In case of long-distance network partitions and/or sysadmin / system management
 subnetwork outages, you may not even be able to (remotely) start STONITH
 at at.
 Thus the above method misses an important failure scenario.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some people seem to have a 
\emph on
binary
\emph default
 view at the healthiness of a system: in their view, a system is either
 operational, or it is damaged.
 This kind of view is ignoring the fact that some systems may be half-alive,
 showing only 
\emph on
minor
\emph default
 problems, or occurring only from time to time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is obvious that damaging a healthy system is a bad idea by itself.
 Even 
\emph on
generally
\emph default
 damaging a half-alive system in order to

\begin_layout Standard
Even worse: in a distributed system

 it would be an extremely unlikely scenario.
 For long-distance replication, this assumption is simply not true.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 you sometimes

cannot(!)

 know whether a system is healthy, or to what degree it is healthy.
 Typical STONITH methods as used in some contemporary clustermanagers are

For some

 cases of the shared-disk model, there exist some justifications for doing
 STONITH 
\emph on
before
\emph default
 starting the application at the hot standby.
 Under certain circumstances, it can happen that system A running amok could
 destroy the data on your single shared disk (example: a filesystem doubly
 mounted 
\emph on

\emph default

\family typewriter

 This argument is only valid for 
\emph on
passive

 disks which are 
\emph on
directly
\emph default
 attached to 
\emph on
both
\emph default
 systems A and B, such that there is no 
\emph on

 In case of iSCSI running over ordinary network equipment such as routers
 or switches, the argument 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fencing the disk is otherwise not possible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 does not apply.
 You can interrupt iSCSI connection at the network gear, or you can often
 do it at cluster A or at the iSCSI target.
 Even commercial storage appliances speaking iSCSI can be remotely controlled
 for forcefully aborting iSCSI sessions.
 In modern times, the STONITH method has no longer such a justification.
 The justification stems from ancient times when a disk was a purely passive
 mechanical device, and its disk controller was part of the server system.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For database applications where no transactions should get lost, you should
 slightly modify the order of operations: first fence the old side A, then
 start the application at standby side B.
 However, be warned that even this cannot guarantee that no transaction
 is lost.
 When the network between A and B is interrupted 
\emph on
before
\emph default
 the incident happens, DRBD will automatically disconnect, and MARS will
 show a lagbehind.
 In order to fully eliminate this possibility, you can either use DRBD and
 configure it to hang forever during network outages (such that users will
 be unable to commit any transactions at all), or you can use the shared-disk
 model instead.
 But in the latter case, you are introducing a SPOF at the single shared
 disk.
 The former case is logically almost equivalent to shared-disk, but avoiding
 some parts of the physical SPOF.
 In a truly distributed system, the famous CAP theorem is limiting your
 possibilities.
 Therefore, no general solution exists fulfilling all requirements at the

 Only during the relatively small time period where application traffic
 was going to the old side A while not replicated to B due to the incident,
 a very small number of updates 
\emph on
could
\emph default
 have gone lost.
 In fields like webhosting, this is taken into account.
 Users will usually not complain when some (smaller amount of) data is lost
 due to split-brain.
 They will complain when the service is unavailable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This method is the fastest for restoring availability, because it doesn't
 try to execute any (remote) action at side A.
 Only from a sysadmin's perspective, there remain some cleanup tasks to
 be done during the following repair phase, such as split-brain resolution,
 which are outside the scope of this treatment.

\begin_layout Standard
By running the application fencing step

sequentially
\emph default

 Your service will take longer to be available again, while the amount of
 lost data is typically somewhat smaller.

 In long-distance replication scenarios with high update traffic, there

 According to the laws of Einstein and the laws of Distributed Systems like
 the famous CAP theorem, this isn't the fault of DRBD+proxy or MARS, but
 simply the

consequence
\emph default
 of having long distances.
 If you want to protect against data loss as best as possible, then don't

 Use

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whatever you decide to do in what case in whatever priority order, whether

\begin_layout Standard
However, some

 This ambiguity will be resolved in a future MARS release.
 It is however not crucial: the resolution methods for both cases are very
 similar.
 If in doubt, start emergency resolution first, and only proceed to split

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Preconditions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Only current version of MARS: the space at the primary side should have
 been already released, and the emergency mode should have been already
 left.
 Otherwise, you might need the split-brain resolution method from section

\end_layout

\end_inset

When necessary, fix the network first (see instructions above).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Emergency mode should now be resolved via the following instructions: 
\begin_inset listings

\begin_layout Plain Layout

primary:~# marsadm view-is-emergency all
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

primary:~# du -s /mars/resource-* | sort -n

Remember the affected resources.
 Best practice is to do the following, starting with the 
\emph on
biggest
\emph default
 resource as shown by the 
\family typewriter
du | sort
\family default
 output in reverse order, but 
\emph on
starting
\emph default

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hint: during the resolution process, some other resources might have gone
 into emergency mode concurrently.
 In addition, it is possible that some secondaries are stuck at particular
 resources while the corresponding primary has

 Please repeat the steps in such a case, and look for emergency modes at
 secondaries additionally.
 When necessary, extend your list of

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hint: be patient.
 Deleting large bulks of logfile data may take a long time, at least on
 highly loaded systems.
 You should give the cleanup processes at least 5 minutes before concluding

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In very complex scenarios, when the primary roles of different resources
 are spread over diffent hosts (aka mixed operation), you may need to repeat
 the whole cycle iteratively for a few cycles until the jam is resolved.

Emergency switching is necessary when your primary is no longer reachable

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Emergency switching will very often lead to a split brain, which requires

Hint: MARS can automatically recover after a primary crash / reboot, as
 well as after secondary crashes, just by executing 
\family typewriter
modprobe mars

 Please consider to wait until your system comes up again, instead of risking
 a split brain.
\end_layout

When your target is syncing (like in this example), you cannot switch to
 it (same as with DRBD).
 When you had an emergency mode before, you should first resolve that (whenever

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hint: in case the secondary is inconsistent for some reason, e.g.
 because of an incremental fast full-sync, you have a last chance to recover
 most data after forceful switching by using a filesystem check or suchalike.
 This might be even faster than restoring data from the backup.

 then starting over afresh.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before re-connecting any network cable on any non-primary (new secondaries),
 ensure that all 
\family typewriter
/dev/mars/mydata
\family default
 devices are no longer in use (e.g.
 from an old primary role before the incident happened), and that each local
 disk is detached.
 Only after that, you should be able to safely re-connect the network.
 The 
\family typewriter
delete-resource
\family default
 given at the new primary should propagate now to each of your secondaries,
 and your local disk should be usable for a re-
\family typewriter
join-resource
\family default
.

When you did not rebuild your cluster from scratch with fresh

 filesystems, and one of the old cluster nodes is supposed to be removed
 permanently, use 
\family typewriter
leave-resource
\family default
 (optionally with

The following is a further alternative for

 who really know what they are doing.
 The method is very simple and therefore well-suited for coping with mass
 failures, e.g.
 
\series bold
power blackout of whole datacenters

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In case a primary datacenter fails as a whole for whatever reason and you
 have a backup datacenter, do the following steps in the backup datacenter:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Fencing step: by means of firewalling, 
\series bold
ensure
\series default
 that the (virtually) damaged datacenter nodes 
\series bold
cannot
\series default
 be reached over the network.
 For example, you may place REJECT rules into all of your local iptables
 firewalls at the backup datacenter.
 Alternatively / additionally, you may block the routes at the appropriate
 central router(s) in your network.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Run the sequence 
\family typewriter
marsadm disconnect all; marsadm primary --force all
\family default
 on all nodes in the backup datacenter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Restart your services in the backup datacenter (as far as necessary).
 Depending on your network setup, further steps like switching BGP routes
 etc may be necessary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Check that 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 your services are 
\emph on
really

 up and running, before you try to repair anything! Failing to do so may
 result in data loss when you execute the following restore method for

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now your backup datacenter should continue servicing your clients.
 The final reconstruction of the originally primary datacenter works as
 follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
At the damaged primary datacenter, ensure that nowhere the MARS kernel module
 is running.
 In case of a power blackout, you shouldn't have executed an automatic 
\family typewriter
modprobe mars
\family default
 anywhere during reboot, so you should be already done when all your nodes
 are up again.
 In case some nodes had no reboot, execute 
\family typewriter
rmmod mars
\family default
 everywhere.
 If 
\family typewriter
rmmod
\family default
 refuses to run, you may need to umount the 
\family typewriter
/dev/mars/mydata
\family default
 device first.
 When nothing else helps, you may just mass reboot your hanging nodes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
At the failed side, do 
\family typewriter
rm -rf /mars/resource-$mydata/
\family default
 for all those resources which had been primary before the blackout.
 Do this 
\emph on
only
\emph default
 for those cases, otherwise you will need unnecessary 
\family typewriter
leave-resource
\family default
s or 
\family typewriter
invalidate
\family default
s later (e.g.
 when half of your nodes were already running at the surving side).
 In order to avoid unnecessary traffic, please do this only as far as really
 necessary.
 Don't remove any other directories.
 In particular, 
\family typewriter
/mars/ips/
\family default
 
\emph on
must
\emph default
 remain intact.
 In case you accidentally deleted them, or you had to re-create 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 from scratch, try 
\family typewriter
rsync
\family default
 with the correct options.

 Caution! before doing this, check that the corresponding directory exists

really

Un-Fencing: restore your network firewall / routes and check that they work
 (

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Do 
\family typewriter
modprobe mars

 everywhere.
 All missing directories and their missing symlinks should be automatically

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Run 
\family typewriter
marsadm join-resource $res
\family default
, but only at those places where the directory was removed previously, while
 using the same disk devices as before.
 This will minimize actual traffic thanks to the fast full sync algorithm.

It is 
\series bold
crucial
\series default
 that the fencing step 
\series bold
must
\series default
 be executed 
\emph on
before
\emph default
 any 
\family typewriter
primary --force
\family default
! This way, no split brain will be 
\emph on
visible
\emph default
 at the backup datacenter side, because there is simply no chance for transferri
ng different versions over the network.
 It is also crucial to remove any (potentially diverging) resource directories
 
\emph on
before
\emph default
 the 
\family typewriter
modprobe
\family default
! This way, the backup datacenter never runs into split brain.
 This saves you a lot of detail work for split brain resolution when you
 have to restore bulks of nodes in a short time.

In case the repair of a full datacenter should take so extremely long that
 some 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 partitions are about to run out of space at the surviving side, you may
 use the 
\family typewriter
leave-resource --host=failed-node
\family default
 trick described earlier, followed by 
\family typewriter
log-delete-all
\family default
.
 Best if you have prepared a fully automatic script long before the incident,
 which executes suchalike only as far as necessary in each individual case.

Even better: train such scenarios in advance, and prepare scripts for mass
 automation.
